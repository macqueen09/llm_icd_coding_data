earlier today, burning and stabbing in nature with one episode 
of vomiting and associated shortness of breath. The pain 
resolved without intervention within ___ minutes and occurred 
while she was walking to the bathroom. She has had this 
sensation in the past and reports this was not the first 
episode.  
 Her cardiac/pulmonary issues essentially began in ___, when 
she had symptoms of dyspnea on exertion and was admitted to 
___ for cardiac cath, and was found to have severe mitral 
regurgitation and a total occlusion of the RCA. She was 
subsequently evaluated by cardiac surgery for possible CABG/MVR 
surgery, however they did not proceed with surgery at that time. 
 
 On ___ she presented to ___ with respiratory 
distress, decompensated CHF, and had a PEA arrest for  which she 
had CPR performed, was intubated, and resuscitated in   the ICU. 
Echo at OSH showed EF 20% with severe MR. ___ was   transferred 
on ___, discharged ___ and has since been followed by 
cardiac surgery.   Her surgery was further delayed due to 
findings during pre-operative testing including severe 
lymphadenopathy on CT chest and a left renal mass. These 
findings needed to be further investigated prior to moving 
forward with cardiac surgery.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mrs. ___ was admitted to the ___ on ___ for IV heparin 
and preoperative workup for her mitral valve surgery. She was 
worked-up in the usual preoperative manner. Heparin was 
continued for anticoagulation for her chronic atrial 
fibrillation. On ___, she was taken to the operating room 
where she underwent replacement of her aortic valve using a 29mm 
___ Porcine valve. Please see operative note for 
details. Post-operatively she was taken to the intensive care 
unit for monitoring. Over the next several hours, she awoke 
neurologically intact and was extubated. She was somnolent and 
hypercarbic. Later that evening she was not following commands 
but moved all extremities. She was then observed to have
vertical nystagmus followed by upgaze to the left and head 
twitching that soon involved left upper extremity rhythmic 
moving. Her lower extremities did not move. Resolved without 
intervention, episode lasted for 1min. She was reintubated 
afterwards. Neurology was consulted and she underwent a 
non-contrast head CT which was negative for acute process. EEG 
was abnormal.  Head and neck CTA revealed patent intracranial 
vasculature without significant stenosis, occlusion or 
aneurysm, 50% stenosis of the left internal carotid artery, 
ulcerated plaque at the left internal carotid artery origin, 
atherosclerotic stenosis at the origin of the left vertebral 
artery.  Keppra was initiated with Lorazepam prn for seizure 
activity.  
She remained hemodynamically stable and was transferred to the 
telemetry floor for further recovery.  Coumadin was resumed for 
AFib.  She was evaluated by the physical therapy service for 
assistance with strength and mobility. By the time of discharge 
on POD 7 she was ambulating with assistance, the wound was 
healing, and pain was controlled with oral analgesics. She was 
discharged to ___ in good 
condition with appropriate follow up instructions.

standpoint; vital signs were routinely monitored. Good pulmonary 
toilet, and ambulation were encouraged throughout 
hospitalization. 
GI/GU/FEN: The patient was initially kept NPO with 
administration of intravenous antacid medication q 12 hours.  On 
HD3, she underwent upper endoscopy which revealed a 2 cm 
marginal ulcer and confirmed the presence of a gastro-gastric 
fistula.  Post-procedure, the diet was advanced to a Regular 
diet, which was well tolerated with abdominal pain, nausea or 
vomiting.  Patient's intake and output were closely monitored.  
Of note, on HD4, the patient had an episode of symptomatic 
hypoglycemia which she had been experiencing prior to admission.

","K9589: Other complications of other bariatric procedure
- Reason: The patient had a gastro-gastric fistula, which is a complication of her previous Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery.

K316: Fistula of stomach and duodenum
- Reason: The patient has a documented gastro-gastric fistula, which is a specific type of fistula involving the stomach.

Y832: Surgical operation with anastomosis, bypass or graft as the cause of abnormal reaction of the patient, or of later complication, without mention of misadventure at the time of the procedure
- Reason: The patient underwent a reversal of her Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, and the presence of a gastro-gastric fistula suggests a complication related to the anastomosis from the initial bariatric surgery.

Y929: Unspecified place or not applicable
- Reason: This code is often used to indicate the place of occurrence or is not applicable. Given that the place of occurrence is not specified in the medical record, this code can be used.

G4733: Obstructive sleep apnea (adult) (pediatric)
- Reason: The patient is on Modafinil, a medication commonly prescribed for obstructive sleep apnea. However, this diagnosis is not explicitly mentioned in the medical record, so this code may not be fully supported by the documentation.

F419: Anxiety disorder, unspecified
- Reason: The patient is on Lorazepam, which is commonly prescribed for anxiety disorders. This supports the presence of an anxiety disorder, although it is not explicitly diagnosed in the medical record.

F329: Major depressive disorder, single episode, unspecified
- Reason: The patient is on Fluoxetine, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) commonly prescribed for major depressive disorder. This supports the presence of a depressive disorder, although it is not explicitly diagnosed in the medical record.

J45909: Unspecified asthma, uncomplicated
- Reason: The patient is on Albuterol, a medication commonly prescribed for asthma. However, this diagnosis is not explicitly mentioned in the medical record, so this code may not be fully supported by the documentation.

E669: Obesity, unspecified
- Reason: The patient has a history of obesity, which is a significant factor leading to her bariatric surgery and ongoing health issues.

K287: Chronic gastrojejunal ulcer without hemorrhage or perforation
- Reason: The patient has a marginal ulcer, which is a chronic condition involving the gastrojejunal anastomosis site. This is consistent with the documented diagnosis of a marginal ulcer.

Z6832: Body mass index [BMI] 32.0-32.9, adult
- Reason: The patient has a history of obesity, and a BMI of 32.0-32.9 is consistent with the classification of obesity.

persistent constipation, wound discharge, fevers, and incisional 
pain following a Roux-en-Y gastric bypass reversal on ___ 
(discharged ___. She was admitted to the ___ 
service for IV antibiotics and to rule out a wound infection. 

Her labs, physical exam, and vital signs were monitored closely 
for signs of infection, of which there were none. She remained 
afebrile and hemodynamically stable throughout her admission 
(Tmax 99.0). Her white blood cell count was stable at 5.1. Her 
hematocrit was stable at 27.1 (up from 25.1 during her previous

acetaminophen, which controlled her pain well, and then was 
transitioned to oral acetaminophen.  

She tolerated a Stage 3 and 4 bariatric diet well. She had a 
bowel movement on HD2. She was given subcutaneous heparin BID 
for DVT prophylaxis.  

A CT scan abd/pelvis was obtained which showed no obstruction, 
fluid collection, or inflammation. Expected postoperative 
anatomy was seen.

At the time of discharge, the patient was doing well, afebrile 
and hemodynamically stable. The patient was tolerating a 
bariatric stage 4 diet, ambulating, voiding without assistance, 
and pain was well controlled. The patient received discharge 
teaching and follow-up instructions with understanding

Followup Instructions:
___
","K5903: Drug induced constipation
- The patient endorses 1 week of constipation, which is noted to have resolved on the day of admission with 3 large bowel movements. The patient was taking opioids (OxyCODONE) regularly, which are known to cause constipation. This is further supported by the discharge instructions, which include information on managing constipation as a side effect of pain medication.

E440: Moderate protein-calorie malnutrition
- There is no direct evidence in the medical record to support a diagnosis of moderate protein-calorie malnutrition. The patient""s labs show normal albumin levels (3.8), which is a marker of nutritional status. Therefore, this code may not be applicable.

T40605A: Adverse effect of unspecified narcotics, initial encounter
- The patient was taking opioids (OxyCODONE) regularly, which contributed to her constipation. The discharge summary mentions that she was weaned off opioids due to their contribution to constipation. This supports the coding of an adverse effect of narcotics.

Y92009: Unspecified place in unspecified non-institutional (private) residence as the place of occurrence of the external cause
- The patient presented to the emergency room, but the place of occurrence is not specified in the medical record. This code may not be applicable or necessary based on the available information.

F419: Anxiety disorder, unspecified
- The patient""s pre-admission medication list includes lorazepam, which is used for anxiety. This suggests that the patient has a history of anxiety, supporting the coding of an anxiety disorder.

Y838: Other surgical procedures as the cause of abnormal reaction of the patient, or of later complication, without mention of misadventure at the time of the procedure
- The patient has a history of multiple surgical procedures, including a Roux-en-Y gastric bypass and revision for a marginal ulcer. The current admission is related to wound discharge and abdominal pain following these surgeries, indicating a potential complication or abnormal reaction to the surgical procedures.

G4733: Obstructive sleep apnea (adult) (pediatric)
- The patient is taking modafinil, which is commonly used to treat excessive daytime sleepiness associated with obstructive sleep apnea. This suggests that the patient has a history of sleep apnea, supporting the coding of this condition.

M549: Dorsalgia, unspecified
- The patient has a history of back pain, which is mentioned in the past medical history. This supports the coding of dorsalgia, unspecified.

M542: Cervicalgia
- The patient has a history of neck pain, which is mentioned in the past medical history. This supports the coding of cervicalgia.

M25559: Pain in unspecified hip
- The patient has a history of hip pain, which is mentioned in the past medical history. This supports the coding of pain in the unspecified hip.

Z6831: Body mass index [BMI] 31.0-31.9, adult
- The patient has a history of obesity, which is mentioned in the past medical history. However, the exact BMI is not provided in the medical record. The code Z6831 is specific to a BMI of 31.0-31.9, and without the actual BMI, this code may not be accurately applied.","You are a coder who is proficient in ICD10.

been using CPAP at home (mask has not fit since she lost weight 
after Roux-en-Y). Also with significant iron-deficiency anemia 
for which iron dextran infusion was started. By discharge, 
patient reported significant improvement in her fatigue. 

#Iron deficiency anemia:
Chronic anemia with Hgb ___ range. Does not appear to be acutely 
worsened though notable for very low iron studies. Likely 
etiology is poor PO intake, nausea, vomiting, and complex GI 
surgical history. Treated with IV iron dextran infusion while 
hospitalized and started on oral iron supplementation on 
discharge. She may benefit from IV dextran infusions in the 
future and should have regular monitoring of her CBC. 

#Nausea/vomiting
#Malnutrition
#Thiamine deficiency:
Described symptoms of progressively worsening nausea and 
vomiting x1 month since prior surgery discharge. Overall no 
significant vomiting episodes on floor and required only minimal 
anti-emetics. She was supplemented with MVI and IV Thiamine 
while hospitalized. Thiamine level was pending at time of 
discharge. She should also start additional supplementation on 
discharge based on levels of Ca, Vitamin D, and Vitamin B12. She 
tolerated a regular diet while hospitalized though in the future 
if nutrition remains a concern, discussions about tube feeds may 
need to be approached.

#Headache:
Initially concerning for chronic bleed or increased ICP given 
chronicity (x1 month). Also with symptoms of photophobia, though 
no positional or temporal changes. CT head was negative for 
acute pathology. Headache resolved over course of admission with 
fluid repletion and Tylenol over course of admission. 

#Lower extremity edema:
Most likely from reduced mobility vs. malnutrition. BNP 
negative. TTE showed preserved biventricular systolic function 
with mild TR.

#Ulcer at G-J anastamosis: Noted on EGD ___. Continued 
Pantoprazole 40 mg PO Q12H. She was due for repeat EGD in ___ for which she never presented. She will need to follow-up 
on this after discharge.

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES
===================
[ ] EGD in ___ revealed 2 cm clean based ulcer at G-J 
anastomosis. She was started on PPI BID at that time with 
recommendation to have repeat EGD 12 weeks later to monitor for 
resolution. She never had follow-up EGD and should attend her GI 
appointment (as listed above). Should also discuss the need to 
continue PPI BID at that time
[ ] F/u Thiamine level (pending from hospitalization)
[ ] Advise checking zinc level as low zinc levels can result in 
dysgeusia (which patient was intermittently endorsing)
[ ] Advise checking B12, Vitamin D, Calcium levels to determine 
need for supplementation 
[ ] Please check CBC in 1 week after discharge. H/H on discharge 
8.___.2. 
[ ] ___ benefit from IV dextran infusions as an outpatient. 
Tolerated well during this admission with improvement in her 
fatigue
[ ] Continue to monitor po intake, which has been difficult 
since Roux-en-Y reversal given intermittent nausea/vomiting. If 
poor nutrition persists, discussions about the role of tube 
feeds may need to be approached
[ ] MEDICATIONS STARTED: Ferrous sulfate, Multivitamin, Thiamine
[ ] MEDICATIONS STOPPED: None
[ ] MEDICATIONS CHANGED: None

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___,

You were admitted to ___ after experiencing worsening fatigue 
and reporting ongoing reduced appetite associated with nausea. 
You were found to have very low iron levels in relation to your 
anemia, for which you received IV iron infusions and reported 
improvement in your symptoms. You were also supplemented with IV 
thiamine and a multi-vitamin given concern for nutritional 
deficiencies as your oral intake has been limited by nausea and 
decreased appetite in the setting of your GI surgeries. We are 
reassured by your regular consumption of meals at this time, 
though you should attend your follow-up appointments with your 
surgical and GI specialists as listed below.

We have started you on the following medications: Iron, 
Multivitamin, Thiamine. 

Please be sure to attend all of the follow-up appointments 
listed below.

It was a pleasure taking care of you!

We wish you the best!

Your ___ Team
 
Followup Instructions:
___
","Certainly! Here are the reasons for each ICD-10 code based on the evidence from the medical record:

**D508: Other iron deficiency anemias**
- Reason: The patient presented with severe iron deficiency anemia, as evidenced by her laboratory results showing low hemoglobin (Hgb: 7.9), very low iron levels (Iron: 29), and low ferritin (Ferritin: 9.8). She received IV iron dextran infusions and was started on oral iron supplementation.

**G629: Polyneuropathy, unspecified**
- Reason: This code is not applicable based on the provided medical record. There is no mention of polyneuropathy or symptoms related to it.

**K289: Gastrojejunal ulcer, unspecified as acute or chronic, without hemorrhage or perforation**
- Reason: The patient has a history of a marginal ulcer at the G-J anastomosis noted on EGD, and she is currently on pantoprazole for management. While the ulcer is not actively mentioned in the current presentation, it is part of her relevant medical history.

**E519: Thiamine deficiency, unspecified**
- Reason: The patient presented with symptoms of thiamine deficiency, including fatigue and malnutrition. Her thiamine level was pending at discharge, and she was supplemented with IV thiamine and started on oral thiamine supplementation.

**K9589: Other complications of other bariatric procedure**
- Reason: The patient has a history of Roux-en-Y gastric bypass complicated by a gastro-gastric fistula, which was reversed. The current presentation includes complications such as malnutrition and anemia, which are related to her bariatric surgical history.

**G4733: Obstructive sleep apnea (adult) (pediatric)**
- Reason: The patient has a history of central and obstructive sleep apnea, and she reported not using her CPAP machine due to a poorly fitting mask after weight loss. This is a relevant part of her medical history and contributes to her fatigue.

**R51: Headache**
- Reason: The patient presented with a persistent tension headache, which was evaluated and managed during her hospital stay. The headache resolved with fluid repletion and Tylenol.

**R600: Localized edema**
- Reason: The patient had trace edema in her extremities to mid-shin, which was noted in the physical exam. This edema is likely related to her reduced mobility and malnutrition.

**M542: Cervicalgia**
- Reason: The patient has a history of neck pain, which is mentioned in her past medical history. This is a chronic condition contributing to her overall symptomatology.

**M549: Dorsalgia, unspecified**
- Reason: The patient has a history of back pain, which is mentioned in her past medical history. This is a chronic condition contributing to her overall symptomatology.

**R3915: Urgency of urination**
- Reason: This code is not applicable based on the provided medical record. There is no mention of urgency of urination or any urinary symptoms.

**Z6830: Body mass index [BMI] 30.0-30.9, adult**
- Reason: The patient has a history of obesity, which is mentioned in her past medical history. Although the exact BMI is not provided, the code is appropriate if her BMI falls within the specified range.","You are a coder who is proficient in ICD10.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
___ Right frontal craniotomy for brain biopsy
 
History of Present Illness:
The patient is a ___ year old man with a significant history of 
multiple concussions who presented to OSH ED after he had what 
he thought was a seizure and was subsequently transferred to 
___ after MRI demonstrated frontal lobe edema. 

History provided by patient, who is very tired on exam. He 
requested that I not wake his parents, who he lives with and 
know him well, for further details as they were asleep. Per 
patient, he has been feeling more tired over past few weeks but 
thought it was related to dehydration. He may have had some 
fever, chills but is not sure. He did have some trouble focusing 
at that time
but again was attributing it to dehydration> he notes that he 
truly felt unwell on ___. 

He is a ___ and was at practice when all of a sudden he 
had significant word-finding difficulties. He initially thought 
he was dehydrated. He went home and had some water and a snack 
then went to take a nap. He woke up at 0200 and couldn't move 
his body for 15 seconds. He decided at this time to drink more 
water the next day thinking he would be better off. On ___, 
he said he was still feeling off but had no real incidents. 
However, on ___ morning, he woke up and ate a peanut 
butter and banana sandwich and drank water, thinking the 
sandwich would help him feel less tired. He then went out for 
lunch with ""the guys"" and had 2 guiness glasses and ___ cups of
water. He felt very tired then and decided to cancel all of 
evening appointments. At 0230 AM that night, he woke up and took 
off his CPAP. All of a sudden, his right arm got stiff and 
flexed outwards, describing a figure of 4 position with his left 
arm. He couldn't move his arm up or down. This lasted about 2 
minutes. As soon as he felt ""released"" he started throwing up. 
He couldn't get up right away as his legs were ""not 
cooperating."" He finally
got up and started vomiting in the bathroom. He had tongue 
lacerations but no incontinence. He wasn't feeling well but fell 
back asleep. In the morning, he still did not feel well so he 
called EMS. 

Regarding concussion history:
-endorses at least 14. mostly sports related when he was 
younger. he also got into car accident. His most notable 
concussion was in ___ when he walked into a fight between high 
risk kids as part of his job as a ""paraprofessional?"" He lost 
consciousness and had some head imaging done there. He had 
significant headaches and memory loss after this event and 
resorted to calling everyone
""___"" and ""darling"" because he could not remember names. 
___ his symptoms improved but he still had to live with his 
parents for ongoing concussive symptoms (current living 
arrangements are unclear per his history). 

His most recent concussion was in ___. He got hit with a ball. 
No loss of consciousness but instantly knew that he would have 
concussion. He again had memory loss after this event but it has 
reportedly started to improve since.

On neurologic review of systems, the patient endorses a ___ 
frontal headache. No lightheadedness or confusion. He also 
endorses right shoulder pain. Only travel history notable for St

IMAGING
=======
MRI head w and w/o contrast ___ (second read)
FINDINGS:
There is diffuse geographic FLAIR subcortical hyperintense 
signal involving the right frontal lobe, insula and temporal 
lobe extending across midline via the corpus callosum to involve 
the left frontal lobe.  Subtle patchy regions of subcortical 
enhancement of the right frontal lobe (series 4, image 20) is 
identified.  This is associated with small patchy areas of 
diffusion restriction (series 4, image 19; series 400, image 
19).  No evidence of hemorrhage.  Associated mass effect 
minimally effaces the frontal horn of the right lateral 
ventricle causes 2-3 mm of leftward midline shift.  No evidence 
of infarction.  Major intracranial flow voids are preserved.  
Dural venous sinuses appear patent.  There is minimal mucosal 
thickening of the ethmoidal air cells and left maxillary sinus.  
Orbits are unremarkable.

IMPRESSION:
1. Region of abnormal FLAIR hyperintensity predominantly 
involving the right frontal and temporal lobes, but also 
crossing the corpus callosum to involve the left frontal lobe.  
Patchy regions of subtle enhancement is identified, with small 
regions demonstrating slow diffusion. 
2. Overall the findings would suggest glioma, with regions of 
slow diffusion and subtle patchy enhancement suggesting possible 
higher grade.  Differential considerations include lymphoma, 
however this would be expected to demonstrate more homogeneous 
enhancement as well as greater associated slow diffusion. 
3. This is felt to be less likely encephalitis given lack of 
associated 
cortical thickening.  No acute infarct or intracranial 
hemorrhage. 
4. Additional findings as described above.

DISCHARGE LABS
==============
See OMR for additional labs or imaging results.
 
Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ is a ___ year old man with a significant history of 
multiple concussions who presented to OSH ED with gradual 
progressive confusion and 2 episodes of right arm tonic 
stiffening with intact awareness. He was found to have right 
frontal mass. 

#Right frontal lobe lesion:
The patient was initially brought to an OSH where he had an MRI 
brain revealing prominent R frontal FLAIR hyperintensities 
extending inferiorly to the temporal lobe and medially across 
the corpus callosum, with very minimal (if any) contrast 
enhancement. He was brought to ___ for further evaluation. The 
patient was started on dexamethasone and keppra. Repeat imaging 
revealed extensive right frontal predominantly white matter 
abnormality with scattered areas of enhancement. 
He underwent craniotomy for brain biopsy with Dr. ___ on 
___. There were no issues perioperatively and the patient 
recovered well in the PACU. He was tolerating a diet, 
ambulating, and voiding without issue POD 1. He was discharged 
home from the PACU on ___ with follow-up to Brain Tumor 
Clinic and the ___ for a wound check and staple 
removal.

#Focal seizures:
Developed ___ month history of gradually progressive cognitive 
problems, specifically mild anomia (difficulty remembering names 
of children he coaches for ___), inattention and 
disorientation. Notably has some intellectual delay at baseline 
(attentional, mild anomia). The week of presentation he also had 
two events highly suspicious for seizure, characterized by right 
arm tonic stiffening, one with severe tongue biting, followed by 
right sided weakness that improved over several hours. He was 
initially brought to an OSH where he had an MRI brain revealing 
prominent R frontal FLAIR hyperintensities extending inferiorly 
to the temporal lobe and medially across the corpus callosum, 
with very minimal (if any) contrast enhancement. He was brought 
to ___ for further evaluation. Initial exam notable for mild 
inattention, some right arm pain, otherwise nonfocal. Labs 
notable for bland CSF studies (3 WBC), normal protein and 
glucose. Imaging is notable for MRI brain w/ and w/o contrast 
revealing T2 hyperintensities involving the white matter of the 
right frontal lobe, extending to the temporal lobe and crossing 
the corpus callosum, with minimal contrast enhancement. He was 
initiated on keppra 1000 mg BID. He underwent mass biopsy on 
___. Etiology most concerning for malignancy, particularly 
high grade glioma versus CNS lymphoma. The seizures are likely 
secondary to the right frontal lesion, and the fact that 
deficits were ipsilateral to the lesion is consistent with about 
30% of frontal lobe seizure foci.

#Mild ___:
Peak Cr 1.5 while inpatient. ___ baseline Crt is unclear. This 
improved with fluids. Likely pre-renal from poor PO intake.

 
Medications on Admission:
None
 
Discharge Medications:
1.  Acetaminophen 325-650 mg PO Q6H:PRN fever or pain

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___,

It was a pleasure to care for you at the ___ 
___.

WHY DID I COME TO THE HOSPITAL?
--You developed seizures and some more confusion at home.

WHAT HAPPENED WHEN I WAS IN THE HOSPITAL?
--We performed an MRI study of your brain and found a mass. This 
mass may have caused you to have seizures.
--We started you on a new anti seizure medication called Keppra. 
You had no additional seizures in the hospital.
--We took a tissue sample from your brain mass to determine what 
it is.

Surgery
 You underwent a biopsy. A sample of tissue from the lesion in 
your brain was sent to pathology for testing. 
 Please keep your incision dry until your sutures/staples are 
removed. You can remove your dressing 48 hours after surgery and 
leave it open to air.
 You may shower at this time but keep your incision dry.
 It is best to keep your incision open to air but it is ok to 
cover it when outside. 
 Call your surgeon if there are any signs of infection like 
redness, fever, or drainage. 

Activity
 We recommend that you avoid heavy lifting, running, climbing, 
or other strenuous exercise until your follow-up appointment.
 You make take leisurely walks and slowly increase your 
activity at your own pace once you are symptom free at rest. 
___ try to do too much all at once.
 No driving while taking any narcotic or sedating medication. 
 If you experienced a seizure while admitted, you are NOT 
allowed to drive by law for at least 6 months. 
 No contact sports until cleared by your neurosurgeon. You 
should avoid contact sports for 6 months. 

Medications
 Please do NOT take any blood thinning medication (Aspirin, 
Ibuprofen, Plavix, Coumadin) until cleared by the neurosurgeon. 
 You have been discharged on Keppra (Levetiracetam). This 
medication helps to prevent seizures. Please continue this 
medication as indicated on your discharge instruction. It is 
important that you take this medication consistently and on 
time. 
 You may use Acetaminophen (Tylenol) for minor discomfort if 
you are not otherwise restricted from taking this medication.

What You ___ Experience:
 You may experience headaches and incisional pain. 
 You may also experience some post-operative swelling around 
your face and eyes. This is normal after surgery and most 
noticeable on the second and third day of surgery.  You apply 
ice or a cool or warm washcloth to your eyes to help with the 
swelling. The swelling will be its worse in the morning after 
laying flat from sleeping but decrease when up. 
 You may experience soreness with chewing. This is normal from 
the surgery and will improve with time. Softer foods may be 
easier during this time. 
 Feeling more tired or restlessness is also common.
 Constipation is common. Be sure to drink plenty of fluids and 
eat a high-fiber diet. If you are taking narcotics (prescription 
pain medications), try an over-the-counter stool softener.

When to Call Your Doctor at ___ for:
 Severe pain, swelling, redness or drainage from the incision 
site. 
 Fever greater than 101.5 degrees Fahrenheit
 Nausea and/or vomiting
 Extreme sleepiness and not being able to stay awake
 Severe headaches not relieved by pain relievers
 Seizures
 Any new problems with your vision or ability to speak
 Weakness or changes in sensation in your face, arms, or leg

Call ___ and go to the nearest Emergency Room if you experience 
any of the following:
 Sudden numbness or weakness in the face, arm, or leg
 Sudden confusion or trouble speaking or understanding
 Sudden trouble walking, dizziness, or loss of balance or 
coordination
 Sudden severe headaches with no known reason

We wish you all the best,
Your ___ care team
 
Followup Instructions:
___
","Certainly! Here are the reasons for each of the ICD-10 codes based on the medical record:

**C711: Malignant neoplasm of frontal lobe**
- **Reason:** The MRI findings and subsequent biopsy suggest a malignant neoplasm in the right frontal lobe. The imaging shows a mass with characteristics suggestive of a high-grade glioma or CNS lymphoma, which are both types of malignant neoplasms.

**G936: Cerebral edema**
- **Reason:** The MRI report mentions frontal lobe edema, which is a significant finding in the patient""s imaging. The edema is associated with the mass and is contributing to the patient""s clinical presentation.

**N179: Acute kidney failure, unspecified**
- **Reason:** The patient had an elevated creatinine level (1.5) during admission, which improved with fluid administration. This suggests a transient episode of acute kidney failure, likely pre-renal in nature due to poor oral intake.

**Z6841: Body mass index [BMI] 40.0-44.9, adult**
- **Reason:** The physical exam describes the patient as obese, and the BMI range of 40.0-44.9 is consistent with the clinical description and the patient""s physical appearance.

**E669: Obesity, unspecified**
- **Reason:** The patient is described as obese in the physical exam, which is a key finding and relevant to his overall health status.

**R569: Unspecified convulsions**
- **Reason:** The patient presented with two episodes of right arm tonic stiffening, which are highly suspicious for seizures. These events are documented in the history and were managed with anticonvulsant medication (Keppra).

**G4733: Obstructive sleep apnea (adult) (pediatric)**
- **Reason:** The patient uses a CPAP machine, indicating a diagnosis of obstructive sleep apnea. This is a relevant comorbidity that affects his overall health and management.

**R4189: Other symptoms and signs involving cognitive functions and awareness**
- **Reason:** The patient has a history of gradually progressive cognitive problems, including mild anomia (difficulty remembering names), inattention, and disorientation. These symptoms are documented in the history and are part of his clinical presentation.

**Z87820: Personal history of traumatic brain injury**
- **Reason:** The patient has a significant history of multiple concussions, including a notable one where he lost consciousness and had significant headaches and memory loss. This history is important for understanding his current condition and potential long-term effects.

These codes accurately reflect the clinical findings, diagnoses, and relevant history documented in the medical record.","You are a coder who is proficient in ICD10. Now, please analyze and give reasons for the coding based on the medical record text and ICD10 coding results.
    The reasons for such coding should be mainly given in combination with the evidence in the original medical record.
    For codes that may not be applicable, do not output the corresponding reasons and do not perform additional analysis.

History of Present Illness:
Mr. ___ is a ___ with PMH dementia, alpha strep 
endocarditis, COPD, prostate cancer, autonomic dysfunction, CAD 
who presented for the evaluation of syncope.  
 Per ED notes: On the day of admission, the patient's partner

in the bathroom on his side not complaining of pain. She called 
EMS who brought him to ___. He denies fevers/chills, chest 
pain, dyspnea, palpitations or dysuria. He denies any pain. Per 
patient's partner, the patient's baseline heart rate is in 
___. Also, he had work up for ""mycobacterial infection of 
his lung"" given abnormal chest imaging findings.  
 Patient does not remember the circumstances surrounding the 
fall. He denies any symptoms of chest pain or SOB at this time. 
His troponin is mildly elevated at 0.06. His EKG shows sinus 
bradycardia with IVCD in a RBBB like pattern and TWI anteriorly. 
Prior EKG is from over ___ years ago so difcult to use as 
comparison. Given his lack of symptoms and minor troponin 
elevation, this is more likely demand ischemia. Further, he is 
DNR/DNI and invasive procedures do not seem in line with his 
desired care.

delay PR 240 QRC 157 QTc 588 anterior TWI.  
 CXR showed possible pneumonia, started doxycycline given 
penicillin allergy and prolonged QTc.  
 CT head and spine did not show any fracture.  
 Physical exam: AAOx1, mentating at baseline, lying on side, 
comfortable. No facial trauma or pain on palpation. R pupil 
irregular, left reacts to light.  
 RRR no MRG.

 Patient was given: Atorvastatin, aspirin, doxycycline  
 The cardiology fellow was consulted. Given elevated trop at 
0.06 with anterior TWI, decision was to admit to ___ for 
NSTEMI. In the ED had sinus pauses on monitor ~2 seconds during 
his sleep. Also, prior to transfer patient had 2 episodes of 
bradycaria to the 30's during his sleep, these were thought to 
be vasovagal.  
 Vitals on transfer: 0 53 135/60 19 94% RA  
 On the floor, patient is unable to recall event. He denies F/C, 
N/V, SOB, Chest pain, abdominal pain, constipation. He does

Brief Hospital Course:
___ with dementia, non-obstructive CAD, who presents following 
unwitnessed syncopal episode, found to be bradycardic with sinus 
pauses on arrival.

#BRADYCARDIA:
#SINUS PAUSES:  
#FALL: pt has history of bradycardia, and appears to have 
baseline HR in ___ range. The exact nature of his 
fall/syncopal event is unclear (including any transient LOC), 
but suspect it was syncopal in the setting of long pause and/or 
symptomatic bradycardia. Pt is largely asymptomatic now, though 
continues to have pauses ___ sec on telemetry. Pt's 
condition/management options discussed with HCP/partner, who is 
clear that the patient would not want an invasive procedure (has 
this in writing in living will), such as a pacemaker. Not on any 
bradycardia-inducing medications. No further intervention to 
make on this issue. Patient was evaluated by ___, who recommended 
rehab for the patient.

#NSTEMI: Given his lack of symptoms and minor troponin elevation 
(peaked at 0.06 and subsequently downtrended), this was more 
likely demand ischemia, potentially in the setting of 
bradycardia/sinus pauses. Continued home aspirin 81mg.

#?PNA: CXR on admission showed ""increased opacity in the area of 
the right middle lobe on the lateral view may suggest a 
component of infection in the appropriate clinical situation."". 
Given one dose of doxycycline in ED, given pt's penicillin 
allergy and prolonged QTc (as opposed to levo, given QTc 500s). 
However, patient is without fever, cough, SOB, or leukocytosis - 
all making PNA less likely. It was decided not to continue 
antibiotics; pt did not develop any further signs or symptoms of 
PNA.

#LOW-NORMAL EF: LVEF 50% in ___. Is on Lasix at home. CXR w/ 
some e/o volume overload but no edema or crackles; otherwise 
appeared euvolemic on exam. Continued home furosemide 20mg 
daily.
 
#DEMENTIA: unclear what type of dementia patient has. Baseline 
mental status - some confusion, poor memory but able to speak 
and follow commands. Avoided deliriogenic medications and 
managed with delirium precautions while admitted.  

#COPD: Mild wheeze on presentation with forceful expiration. No 
SOB or cough to suggest exacerbation. Continued home 
Fluticasone-Salmeterol Diskus (100/50) 1 INH IH BID.

#GLAUCOMA: Continued home Dorzolamide 2%/Timolol eye drops. 

#GERD: CT from admission (trauma work-up) with ""Thickened upper 
esophageal wall could be sequelae of chronic esophagitis and 
reflux."" Continued home omeprazole 20mg daily.

# Goals of care: patient, health care proxy (partner ___, and 
daughter have been very clear that he would not want aggressive 
measures such as CPR, invasive procedures, dialysis, artificial 
nutrition/hydration, or re-hospitalization unless needed for 
comfort. MOLST form was filled out to document this. 

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES
===================
[ ] Pt is at increased risk of falls and syncope, given known 
bradycardia/sinus pauses and decision not to treat with 
pacemaker.
[ ] Nodal-blocking agents should be avoided in this patient.
[ ] consider palliative care referral as outpatient
# CODE: DNR/DNI (no re-hospitalization unless needed for 
comfort). MOLST form completed.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ was admitted to the hospital and taken to the 
Operating Room where she underwent a redo right thoracotomy, 
tracheobronchoplasty with mesh, and bronchoscopy with lavage. 
She tolerated the procedure well and returned to the TSICU 
extubated and in stable condition. She maintained stable 
hemodynamics and her pain was controlled with an epidural. Her 
___ drain was on suction and drained a moderate amount of 
serosanguinous fluid.  She underwent vigorous pulmonary toilet 
including nebulizers and chest ___ and was doing well. Her pre op 
symptoms were much improved. Her ___ drain was removed on post 
op day #2 as the drainage was minimal and there was no air leak. 
Her post pull chest xray showed no pneumpthorax. her right 
thoracotomy site was healing well and she was tolerating a 
liquid diet.

Following transfer to the Surgical floor her epidural was 
removed and her pain was controlled with Tylenol, Oxycodone and 
Gabapentin.  She continued to work hard with her incentive 
spirometer and nebulizers to keep her airway clear. Her diet was 
gradually advanced to soft solids which was well tolerated. As 
her activity increased she had some spasms around her right 
chest which were relieved with Flexeril.  Her room air 
saturations were 92-96% with activity and her pain was in better 
control. After an uneventful recovery she was discharged to a 
local home on ___ and will follow up with Dr. ___ 
in 2 weeks.

IMAGING
=======================================
+ ___ CXR
Comparison ___.  A previous central venous access 
line has been removed.  Status post CABG.  The alignment of the 
sternal wires is unremarkable.  Pleural calcifications on the 
right.  Moderate cardiomegaly with elongation of the descending 
aorta.  No overt pulmonary edema.  The lateral radiograph shows 
areas of atelectasis along the right fissures.  No larger 
pleural effusions.  Wedge deformity of a thoracic vertebral 
body, previously documented on the CT examination from ___.

___ TTE
Pre Deployment
No spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the body of the left 
atrium. The left atrial appendage emptying velocity is depressed 
(<0.2m/s). A left atrial appendage thrombus cannot be excluded. 
The right atrium is dilated. Regional left ventricular wall 
motion is normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is 
normal (LVEF>55%). The right ventricular cavity is dilated There 
are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. There are 
three aortic valve leaflets. The aortic valve leaflets are 
severely thickened/deformed. There is severe aortic valve 
stenosis (valve area <1.0cm2). Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is 
seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild to 
moderate (___) mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid 
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. The tricuspid valve 
leaflets fail to fully coapt. Severe [4+] tricuspid 
regurgitation is seen. There is no pericardial effusion. Drs. 
___ were notified in person of the results of the exam 
at the time of exam.
Post Deployment
There is a well-seated ___ valve in the aortic position. 
Initially, a mild paravalvular leak was observed. After 
post-dilation, trace paravalvular leak was present. There is no 
new regional wall motion abnormality. Rest of examination is 
unchanged. 

+ ___ TTE 
The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild symmetric left 
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and 
regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%). There is no 
ventricular septal defect. The right ventricular cavity is 
dilated with normal free wall contractility. The diameters of 
aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch levels are normal. An 
___ aortic valve bioprosthesis is present. The aortic 
valve prosthesis leaflets appear to move normally. The 
transaortic gradient is normal for this prosthesis. A 
paravalvular aortic valve leak is probably present. Mild (1+) 
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are 
mildly thickened. There is severe mitral annular calcification. 
There is mild functional mitral stenosis (mean gradient 5 mmHg) 
due to mitral annular calcification. Mild (1+) mitral 
regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly 
thickened. Severe [4+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is 
moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. [In the setting 
of at least moderate to severe tricuspid regurgitation, the 
estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure may be 
underestimated due to a very high right atrial pressure.] There 
is no pericardial effusion. 

___ CT ABD/PELVIS W/O CONTRAST
1. No evidence of high density intra-abdominal fluid collection 
to suggest retroperitoneal hematoma.  Soft tissue irregularity 
in the right groin is consistent with recent percutaneous 
intervention.  There is moderate simple ascites in the abdomen 
and pelvis.
2. Moderate to large left-sided hydrocele with focal high 
density area, which is most likely related to the testicle and 
epididymis.  However this could potentially represent focal 
hemorrhage.  Recommend physical examination of the perineum and 
possible scrotal ultrasound for further evaluation. 
3. Minimal consolidation in the bilateral lower lobes, right 
greater than left which may reflect infection.
4. Slightly nodular liver with a markedly distended IVC and 
hepatic veins may be related to the patient's cardiac 
dysfunction however these findings may be seen in cirrhosis 
particularly in the setting of splenomegaly and intra-abdominal 
ascites.
5. Marked compression deformity of T12 with minimal bony 
retropulsion.  Mottled sclerosis throughout the bony pelvis and 
bilateral femoral heads.  DDX includes ___ a static bone 
disease as well as midline disorders.  
Comparison with previous CT scan/bone films of available 
elsewhere
recommended.  Bone scan may also be considered.
6. Note is made of a moderate to large left-sided hydrocele.
RECOMMENDATION(S):  Comparison with previous CT scan/bone films 
of available elsewhere recommended.  Bone scan may also be 
considered.

Brief Hospital Course:
___ with a history of 4VD CABG ___, afib on coumadin, pHTN, 
chronic anemia, thrombocytosis on agrylin, who was admitted for 
elective TAVR, which patient underwent on ___ without 
complication.  Hospital course was complicated by pneumonia (s/p 
azithromycin course), cystitis (s/p Ceftriaxone course), acute 
on chronic anemia (requiring intermittent transfusions), left 
atrial thrombus and atrial fibrillation (Coumadin with heparin 
gtt bridge), iliacus hematoma (stable on discharge), and acute 
on chronic kidney disease (likely ___ cardiorenal, stable on 
discharge). 
 
# CORONARIES: 3VD s/p CABG
# PUMP:  EF 65%
# RHYTHM:  atrial fibrillation 
 
#) SEVERE AORTIC STENOSIS s/p TAVR: 
Pt has a history of severe aortic stenosis ___ 0.5cm2, peak 
58mmHG, mean 34mmHg).  He was felt to be too high risk for 
surgical aortic valve replacement, so he was admitted for 
elective TAVR.  He underwent uncomplicated TAVR on ___ with 
placement ___ 3 aortic valve bioprosthesis.  
Intra-operative TEE showed LVEF 55%, with ___ aortic 
valve bioprosthesis present with normal transaortic gradient and 
mild (1+) aortic regurgitation.  Repeat TTE ___ was notable 
for LVEF >55%, ___ valve in place with probable 
paravavalvular aortic valve leak, mild (1+) aortic 
regurgitation, and severe (4+) tricuspid regurgitation.  Pt 
received Aspirin 81mg, which he will have to continue lifelong.  
He received one dose of Plavix.  He will continue Coumadin going 
forward.

#) DECOMPENSATED DIASTOLIC HEART FAILURE with ADVANCED RIGHT 
HEART FAILURE AND LIKELY CARDIAC CIRRHOSIS:
Pt has a history of diastolic heart failure with NYHC II-III.  
During hospitalization, pt appeared volume overloaded, likely 
secondary to right heart failure from severe tricuspid 
regurgitation as well as cirrhosis.  Pt was diuresed with Lasix 
80mg IV (once to two times daily), and later transitioned to 
Torsemide 40mg daily.  Discharge weight was 72.2kg. This weight 
was relatively stable on torsemide 40 but needs to be watched 
closely. BP runs low on account of RV failure, but even with 
this he still has some ascites and ___ edema (L>R)

#) SPONTANEOUS ILIACUS HEMATOMA 
Pt developed left sided hip and upper leg pain and was noted to 
have decline in hemoglobin.  CT of the abdomen and pelvis showed 
left iliacus muscle collection suspicious for an intramuscular 
hematoma measuring approximately 3.6 by 5.7 by 9.6cm.  Pt was 
seen by Interventional Radiology, who felt that there was no 
role for endovascular intervention.  Repeat imaging several days 
later showed no interval change in size of the hematoma.  Pt 
required intermittent transfusions but remained hemodynamically 
stable.  For pain management, he received Tylenol, Oxycodone and 
Gabapentin.

#) ACUTE ON CHRONIC ANEMIA:
Pt has a history of chronic anemia.  He developed worsening 
anemia likely secondary to blood loss in setting of iliacus 
hematoma.  He required 3U PRBCs total during hospitalization.  
Pt needs close monitoring of CBC for monitoring of anemia, as 
patient required intermittent transfusions during 
hospitalization.  

#) ACUTE ON CHRONIC KIDNEY DISEASE
Creatinine on admission was 1.4 (unclear baseline).  Creatinine 
increased to a peak of 2, likely secondary to cardiorenal.  
Creatinine stable on discharge.  Discharge Creatinine 1.7.
  
#) NEWLY DIAGNOSED CIRRHOSIS: 
Pt found to have newly diagnosed cirrhosis during admission.  
Imaging consistent with cirrhosis.  Underwent diagnostic 
paracentesis with SAAG>1.1 and Ascites TP<2.5 consistent 
non-cardiac cause of portal hypertension. However, there is 
suspicion that his cardiac pathologies (namely his severe TR and 
RHF) is still likely the driver of his ascites and cirrhosis.  
Pt scheduled for outpatient follow up with Hepatology and will 
likely need an endoscopy for determination of variceal status.

#) ATRIAL FIBRILLATION: 
Pt has a history of atrial fibrillation for which he is managed 
on Coumadin.  During hospitalization, he was managed on Coumadin 
with a heparin gtt bridge. Patient's home Metoprolol Xl dose was 
decreased from 25mg to 12.5mg daily due to hypotension.  Pt was 
discharged on Coumadin 7.5mg daily.  Discharge INR 2.8. Pt will 
need repeat INR check on ___. The 7.5 is down from 10 and 11 
as his last two doses. His INR was very slow to rise now rapidly 
accelerating so with ascites we pulled back. 

#) LEFT ATRIAL THROMBUS
Pt noted to have left atrial thrombus on prior imaging from CT 
Torso.  During hospitalization, he was managed with Coumadin and 
heparin gtt bridge (as above).

#) COMMUNITY ACQUIRED PNEUMONIA:
During hospitalization, pt developed productive cough of 
blood-tinged sputum and CT chest showed peribronchial wall 
thickening in the right lower lobe and scattered ground-glass 
opacities.  Pt completed a course of Azithromycin.  Pt should 
have repeat CT chest in 1 month.

#) COMPLICATED CYSTITIS: 
During hospitalization, pt found to have E.coli UTI.  Pt 
completed a 7-day course of IV Ceftriaxone.  

CHRONIC ISSUES
# CAD: 3VD s/p CABG: continued home statin and aspirin. 
Decreased home Metoprolol dose (as above). 
# Glaucoma: continued home timolol eye drops as needed.  Held 
home Bimatoprost drops (non-formularly), and managed with 
latanoprost drops instead.
# Hypothyroidism: continued home levothyroxine

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES
======================================================
1. Pt's Coumadin was difficult to titrate to therapeutic levels. 
He was therapeutic at 2.8 INR on discharge, but Coumadin had 
recently been increased. Per pharmacy recommendation, should 
start on 7.5 mg ___. Please repeat INR and adjust Coumadin 
accordingly.  Goal INR 2 to 3 for afib and left atrial thrombus.
2. Pt discharged on Torsemide 40mg PO daily.   
3. Pt needs close monitoring of kidney function. Creatinine on 
discharge 1.7.  
4. Pt needs close monitoring of CBC for monitoring of anemia, as 
patient required intermittent transfusions during 
hospitalization.  
5. Pt developed spontaneous iliacus hematoma during 
hospitalization, which was stable on discharge.  Pt should be 
monitored for worsening lower extremity pain or weakness.
6. Pt with multiple morbidity issues (diastolic heart failure, 
severe tricuspid regurgitation, cirrhosis, concern for 
metastatic cancer, advanced age). PCP aware of high morbidity 
and need to further address quality of life.
7. Pt noted on imaging to have abnormal oseeous heterogeneity 
concerning for metastatic disease.  Pt can be scheduled for 
follow up with outpatient PCP and ___ (Dr. ___ 
___ for further evaluation.  
8. Pt noted on CT chest to have peribronchial wall thickening in 
the right lower lobe and scattered ground-glass opacities.  Pt 
received a course of Azithromycin.  pt should have repeat CT 
chest in 1 month.
9. Pt will need to continue taking aspirin 81mg daily lifelong
10. Patient's home Metoprolol Xl dose was decreased from 25mg to 
12.5mg daily due to hypotension.
11. For patient's leg pain, he was started on Gabapentin 100mg 
QHS, which can be slowly increased as tolerated. Pain was also 
managed with Oxycodone as needed.
12. Pt has a questionable history of a liver infection for which 
he is chronically on Amoxicillin.  The indication remained 
unclear during hospitalization so amoxicillin was held 
(particularly while he was taking other antibiotics).  He will 
need to follow up with his primary care physician to determine 
if amoxicillin needs to be resumed.
13. Pt had marked constipation during hospitalization, for which 
he was started on senna and miralax (in addition to his home 
Docusate). 
14. Would recommend hepatitis B vaccination as an outpatient.
15. Pt found to have newly diagnosed cirrhosis during 
hospitalization.  He is scheduled for outpatient follow up with 
Hepatology and will likely need an endoscopy for determination 
of variceal status.

Discharge Instructions:
Mr. ___,

It was a pleasure caring for you during your admission to ___ 
___.  You were admitted for 
treatment of an abnormality of one of your heart valves.  You 
underwent a procedure to fix your valve on ___, which 
you tolerated well.  During your admission, imaging was done 
which was concerning for cirrhosis of your liver.  You were seen 
by the liver team who recommended you follow up with them as an 
outpatient for continued management and monitoring of this.  The

History of Present Illness:
___ yoF with recent dx of PE (___) on apixiban, HTN, CKD who 
presents with chief complaint of dyspnea and tachycardia.  Pt 
also complains of SOB and DOE, breathlessness with deep breaths 
and notes that she is feeling easily fatigued with easy tasks 
such as walking to store from parking lot or cooking.  She does 
not note significant worsening since starting apixiban, just 
lack of improvement.  She also endorses feeling jittery at times 
and has been tachycardic.  She denies significant anxiety and 
has not taken lorazepam in a month or so.  Finally, she 
describes a constant burning sensation in her mid chests that is 
mild and she does not think is heartburn as it does not respond 
to Maalox.  She has this as well as the discomfort with deep 
breaths since her PE was diagnosed.  Finally, she endorses cough 
which is chronic but has been worse over the last week; 
previously had been on a PPI but this was switched to xantac 
recently and pt has not filled the Rx given she feels her sxs 
have been controlled with change and diet and tums.  Pt has not 
been taking sats at home but they have been 98% in the office.  
She has not missed any doses of Eliquis except this AM since she 
was at her PCPs; last dose was given at 7PM in the ED.

In the ED, initial vitals were: 97.9, 112, 136/16, 18, 98% RA.  
Labs were notable for d-dimer of 1737, INR 1.5 Pt was 
persistently tachycardic while in the ED, vitals otherwise 
stable.  EKG showed tachycardia, nl axis, no ischemic changes, 
POCUS with hyperdynamic ventricle, mild RV dilation.  ___ 
started Eliquis.  

On the floor, feels okay currently, mild headache, a little 
anxious.  Cough persists.

Conclusions
The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size. The 
estimated right atrial pressure is ___ mmHg. Mild symmetric left 
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size, and 
regional/global systolic function (biplane LVEF = 65 %). Doppler 
parameters are indeterminate for left ventricular diastolic 
function. Right ventricular chamber size is normal with 
borderline normal free wall function. The diameters of aorta at 
the sinus, ascending and arch levels are normal. The aortic 
valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis or 
regurgitation are not present. The mitral valve leaflets are 
mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Trivial 
mitral regurgitation is seen. The left ventricular inflow 
pattern suggests impaired relaxation. The tricuspid valve 
leaflets are mildly thickened. The estimated pulmonary artery 
systolic pressure is normal. There is a trivial/physiologic 
pericardial effusion.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of ___, 
the findings are similar.

 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ yo F with hx recent dx of PE (___) on apixiban, HTN, CKD who 
presented with chief complaint of dyspnea and tachycardia, 
likely due to recent PE.

# SOB
# tachycardia
# recent unprovoked / idiopathic PE
Pt presented with persistent, although NOT worsening, symptoms 
of SOB and tachycardia in the setting of recent PE diagnosis on 
VQ scan.  She had completed the loading dose of Eliquis and had 
just started the maintenance dose of Eliquis.  Due to her 
symptoms, she was admitted for VQ scan to r/o worsening clot 
burden and possible anticoagulation failure.  She was also 
admitted for concern of right heart strain, as ED point-of-care 
ultrasound showed possible RV dilatation.  However, her troponin 
and BNP were well within normal limits.  Her echocardiogram 
ultimately did not show significant RV strain.  Her repeat VQ 
scan was initially concerning for new PE's, however her original 
images were not available for comparison.  As such, she had her 
Eliquis stopped and she was started on heparin drip for possible 
anti-coagulation failure.  She was then seen by Hematology for ? 
NOAC failure, as well as to comment on the nature of her VTE, as 
the episode appears unprovoked.  Once her original VQ scan 
images were obtained, Radiology felt that her new VQ scan 
actually showed IMPROVING clot burden, so Hematology recommended 
stopping heparin drip and resuming Eliquis, with plan for 
minimum ___ months of anti-coagulation and consideration of 
lifelong anticoagulation.  Her symptoms were improving during 
the hospitalization even prior to change to heparin GTT.  In 
terms of w/u for trigger for PE, she is nearly up-to-date for 
cancer screening (last mammography ___ year ago, is scheduled to 
have one done this year).  Hematology recommended checking 
anti-cardiolipin antibodies and anti-beta-2-glycoprotein 1 
antibodies, but no other thrombophilia work-up.  These 
antibodies were still PENDING at time of discharge.

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
1.  f/u pending anti-cardiolipin and anti-beta-2 glycoprotein 1 
antibodies.  If results are abnormal, will need referral to 
___ ---> negative anti-cardiolipin and negative 
beta-2 GP-1 antibodies.
2.  outpatient mammogram (already scheduled)
3.  on-going discussion re: duration of anticoagulation, minimum 
3 months

Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted to the hospital for persistent shortness of 
breath and elevated heart rate.  You underwent repeat VQ scan 
and an echocardiogram.  VQ scan showed improving blood clots.  
Echocardiogram did not show any significant right heart strain.  
You were seen by the Hematology team and they did not think that 
there was any evidence to suggest failure of your apixaban 
(Eliquis).  Some blood tests were sent to rule out an underlying 
hypercoagulable state (tendency to form clots), with results 
still pending at time of discharge.  Your PCP should ___ 
the results of these tests.

 
Followup Instructions:
___
","I2699: The patient was diagnosed with a pulmonary embolism (PE) and was being treated with apixaban. The medical record indicates that the PE was improving, and there was no evidence of acute cor pulmonale. The code I2699 is appropriate for ""Other pulmonary embolism without acute cor pulmonale.""

Z7901: The patient was on long-term anticoagulation therapy with apixaban (Eliquis). The code Z7901 is used to indicate ""Long term (current) use of anticoagulants.""

I129: The patient has a history of hypertension and chronic kidney disease (CKD). The medical record mentions both conditions, and the code I129 is used for ""Hypertensive chronic kidney disease with stage 1 through stage 4 chronic kidney disease, or unspecified chronic kidney disease.""

N189: The patient has chronic kidney disease (CKD), and the specific stage is not mentioned in the medical record. Therefore, the code N189, which is for ""Chronic kidney disease, unspecified,"" is appropriate.

E669: The patient has a history of obesity, which is mentioned in the past medical history. The code E669 is used for ""Obesity, unspecified.""

F419: The patient reports feeling a little anxious during the hospital stay, but there is no specific diagnosis of an anxiety disorder. The code F419 is used for ""Anxiety disorder, unspecified,"" which can be appropriate if the provider documented anxiety without specifying a particular type.

M549: The patient has a history of a giant cell tumor of the spine, which resulted in hip pain and L-sided neuropathy. The code M549 is used for ""Dorsalgia, unspecified,"" which covers general back pain or discomfort.

M109: There is no mention of gout in the medical record. This code is not applicable.

Z9884: The patient has a history of bariatric surgery (laparoscopic adjustable gastric band). The code Z9884 is used for ""Bariatric surgery status.""

Z6838: The patient""s body mass index (BMI) is not explicitly stated in the medical record, but the code Z6838 is used for ""Body mass index [BMI] 38.0-38.9, adult."" If the BMI was calculated or mentioned elsewhere in the record, this code would be appropriate. However, without explicit documentation, this code may not be fully supported.","You are a coder who is proficient in ICD10.

    occluded at its origin.
4. There is a short segment of reconstitution of the behind-
    the-knee popliteal artery before reocclusion.
5. The right anterior tibial and posterior tibial arteries
    are both occluded in the leg and foot.  The right
    peroneal
    artery provides vessel runoff to the foot.  All 3 tibial
    vessels are heavily calcified.

who was admitted to the vascular surgery service on ___ for 
gangrene of his right first and second toes. He underwent a 
right lower extremity angiogram that showed a long segment right 
femoral occlusion and an occluded ___ with peroneal run off to 
the foot. He also had a patent iliac segment but stenosis in the 
common iliac could not be ruled out. The profunda origin also 
had a severe stenosis. Thus, it
was planned that he would benefit from a femoral endarterectomy 
and potential recanalization of the femoral-popliteal segment 
versus bypass. He subsequently underwent vein mapping which 
showed no suitable conduit. 

He now presents for scheduled femoral endarterectomy with 
possible iliac stenting and hopeful femoral-popliteal 
recanalization potentially with retrograde peroneal access.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ is a ___ year old male with a history of atrial 
fibrillation, CAD s/p CABG x3, aortic stenosis s/p aortic valve 
replacement, and mitral regurgitation who presented to the 
vascular surgery service at ___ 
in ___ with gangrene of his right first and second toes. He 
returned for a scheduled admission on ___. The patient was 
taken to the operating room and underwent endarterectomy of his 
right common and profunda femoral arteries with bovine patch 
angioplasty. For details of the procedure, please see the 
surgeon's operative note. Of note, the case was technically 
challenging with significant blood loss, requiring transfusion 
of 1u pRBCs intraoperatively. A JP drain was placed in the 
patient's right groin given the extent of intraoperative 
bleeding. The patient tolerated the procedure well without 
complications and was brought to the post-anesthesia care unit 
in stable condition. He subsequently had a short run of 
hemodynamically unstable SVT with systolic blood pressures in 
the ___, which resolved spontaneously without intervention. 
After a brief stay, the patient was transferred to the vascular 
surgery floor where he remained through the rest of the 
hospitalization. 

Post-operatively, he did well without any groin swelling or 
bleeding. His hematocrit stabilized, and he remained 
hemodynamically stable without further episodes of arrhythmia. 
On POD1, he was able to get out of bed to a chair and was 
tolerating a regular diet. On POD2, he was able get out of bed 
and ambulate with a cane (which he uses at home), void without 
issues, and pain was controlled on oral medications alone. He 
was deemed ready for discharge on POD3, however it was decided 
to pursue non-invasive studies to determine what the next step 
in his progress would be and whether we should pursue a below 
knee amputation vs a transmetatarsal amputation. Non invasive 
studies revealed that there would be minimal likelihood of 
healing a transmetatarsal amputation, and it was decided to see 
what his residual flow was in his leg via angiogram and if he 
would be amenable to alternative forms of treatment other than 
amputation. Subsequent angiograms showed that he had complete 
occlusion of the superficial femoral artery at its origin with 
single vessel runoff in the peroneal artery. Based on these 
results it was determined that he would be very unlikely to heal 
a transmetatarsal amputation and if he wanted to avoid any 
possible future complications with the gangrene of his toes we 
would recommend a below knee amputation. He was unwilling to 
pursue this course at this time and wanted time to think about 
it before deciding. At the time of discharge his vitals were 
stable. He was eating walking and voiding spontaneously without 
complications. The discharge plan was discussed with the patient 
who verbalized understanding and agreement with the plan.

not available) of ___.   
LEFT ATRIUM: Normal LA size. 

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: RA not well visualized. 

LEFT VENTRICLE: Mild symmetric LVH with normal cavity size. Mild 
regional LV systolic dysfunction. No resting LVOT gradient. 

RIGHT VENTRICLE: RV not well seen. RV function depressed. 
Paradoxic septal motion consistent with prior cardiac surgery. 

AORTA: Mildy dilated aortic root. Normal ascending aorta 
diameter. Normal aortic arch diameter. 

AORTIC VALVE: ?# aortic valve leaflets. No AS. No AR. 

MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets. No MVP. 
Trivial MR. 

___ VALVE: Normal tricuspid valve leaflets with trivial 
TR. TR present - cannot be quantified. Normal PA systolic 
pressure. 

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Pulmonic valve not well seen. 

PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion. 

GENERAL COMMENTS: Suboptimal image quality as the patient was

Conclusions   
 The left atrium is normal in size. There is mild symmetric left 
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size. There is mild 
regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with severe 
hypokinesis of the mid to distal anterior septum and mild 
hypokineis of the apex. The remaining segments contract normally 
(LVEF = 55 %). The right ventircle is not well seen but global 
systolic function is depressed. The aortic root is mildly 
dilated at the sinus level. The number of aortic valve leaflets 
cannot be determined. There is no aortic valve stenosis. No 
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are 
mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Trivial 
mitral regurgitation is seen. Tricuspid regurgitation is present 
but cannot be quantified. The estimated pulmonary artery 
systolic pressure is normal. There is no pericardial effusion. 

 IMPRESSION: Mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction 
c/w CAD (mid LAD). Depressed global right ventricular systolic 
function.

 Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of ___ 
the regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction is similar, 
but EF overall may be better.

Followup Instructions:
___
","I25118: The patient has a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) with symptoms of chest tightness and dyspnea on exertion, which are indicative of angina pectoris. The medical record mentions that the patient had a stress echocardiogram and cardiac catheterization revealing multivessel coronary artery disease, leading to the need for coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). This supports the diagnosis of atherosclerotic heart disease with other forms of angina pectoris.

I10: The patient is on Losartan, an antihypertensive medication, which suggests a diagnosis of essential hypertension. Although hypertension is not explicitly mentioned in the history, the use of this medication strongly indicates the presence of hypertension.

D62: The patient experienced a significant drop in hemoglobin levels (from 10.0 to 7.6) during the hospital stay, which could be indicative of acute posthemorrhagic anemia, especially given the context of recent surgery.

E785: The patient is on Lipitor, a medication used to manage hyperlipidemia, which is also mentioned in the discharge diagnoses. This supports the diagnosis of hyperlipidemia.

I252: The patient has a history of a prior ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), which is documented in the past medical history and discharge diagnoses. This supports the diagnosis of old myocardial infarction.

Z955: The patient underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) with two grafts (LIMA->LAD, SVG->OM), which indicates the presence of a coronary angioplasty implant and graft. This code is appropriate to indicate the presence of the grafts post-surgery.","You are a coder who is proficient in ICD10.

homelessness (currently in shelter), and CVA in ___, who 
presented with palpitations found to have a.flutter with plan 
for ablation on ___. Unfortunately, patient (while in 
holding area for ablation) declined procedure and left AMA 
without coupon card for anti-coagulation. 

ACUTE ISSUES: 
=============
Atrial flutter and history of CVA.
Patient presented with atrial flutter, currently not adherent to
rate control or anticoagulation medication. Give his recurrent
A.flutter, he was scheduled for TEE and atrial flutter ablation 
___, however on the morning of scheduled procedure he left 
AMA.  At point of exit team was working closely with insurance 
on obtaining coverage for DOAC and had offered him a coupon for 
4 weeks of free eilquis but patient left without this coupon.

#HTN, goal <140/90
Patient SBPs persistently in 130-170s. His agitation and pain 
may have contributed to elevated BPs. Goal SBP<140 given recent 
hx of CVA. Uptitrated lisinopril to 5mg daily. Left AMA prior to 
better control of blood pressure. 

# Substance use disorder
# Homelessness
Patient reported EtOH use disorder and homelessness - currently

test script for various anti-coagulation options while he was 
here, but ___ was locked, and he left before we completed 
the process. 
[ ] Patient would benefit from ablation for aflutter. (He also 
has an upcoming ___ appointment with EP in ___ 
[ ] Unclear why patient left AMA. Suspect related to substances 
given he already re-presented to the E.D. just hours after he 
left AMA today. Would get psych involved. ___ also be a 
component of mental disability from prior stroke and history of 
alcohol use disorder. 
[ ] Patient would like benefit from increased dose of lisinopril 
to target SBP <140.

Brief Hospital Course:
===============
BRIEF SUMMARY 
===============

___ year old male with PMHx atrial flutter, opioid use disorder, 
recent rib fractures and HTN who presents with palpitations. He 
was noted to be in typical atrial flutter on admission. He was 
give IV Diltiazem and then PO metoprolol and rates decreased to 
___. He was discharged with instructions to follow up with EP to 
plan future ablation. We decided not to perform an ablation in 
house given our concerns with his ability to reliably take 
anticoagulation as an outpatient in the month following an 
ablation. 

ACUTE ISSUES:
=============
# Typical atrial flutter
Has been seen multiple times in the past several weeks with 
palpitations and confirmed atrial flutter. Offered elective 
ablation though has left AMA multiple times before the procedure 
could occur. Etiology for rapid rate may be missed metoprolol 
doses recently. Substance abuse may also be contributing, though 
patient denies recent use (since overdose ___ weeks ago). He was 
restarted on home metoprolol 6.25 Q6h, apixaban 5mg BID. He was 
monitored on telemetry. He gave us his cell phone number as he 
was walking out and requested that he be called with a clinic 
appointment. 

# Opioid Use Disorder
Including alcohol and intranasal heroin with recent overdose for 
which he was hospitalized at ___. Patient denies 
alcohol use since ___. Social work was consulted. The 
patient was offered to speak with addiction psychiatry to 
discuss addiction treatments including initiation of methadone. 
He was interested but decided to leave. He was encouraged to 
follow up with his PCP to discuss initiation of methadone as he 
appeared interested. He was prescribed naloxone on discharge. We 
offered to relay this concern to his PCP but he did not want us 
to discuss the matter with him. 

# Hypertension
Discharged during last hospitalization on 10mg lisinopril though 
left before dose was uptitrated and control was achieved. 
Remained hypertensive in ED and upon arrival to the floor. His 
Lisinopril was increased to 20 mg daily which was continued on 
discharge.

# Rib fractures
Sustained recently after falling on the ice. Patient denies 
syncopal episode. Diagnosed with rib fractures in ___ ED.

# Homelessness
Reported to ED providers that he felt unsafe at his current 
shelter (___). Confirms to me that he no longer wants to 
stay at that shelter. Social work was consulted but the patient 
decided to leave prior to being seen.

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES
===================
[]Will need follow up with Dr. ___ to discuss EP ablation 
given persistent atrial flutter
[]Lisinopril uptitrated to 20 mg daily given persistently 
elevated BPs
[]Although he declined addiction psychiatry consult while 
inpatient, the patient was pre-comtemplative when discussed 
addiction treatment, would definitely benefit from discussing 
this further as an outpatient.

History of Present Illness:
___ year old male with possible CVA in ___, 
homelessness, alcohol use disorder, opioid use disorder, and 
atrial fibrillation/atrial flutter presents with recurrent 
palpitations.

Please see the numerous other admission notes for this patient 
from the past week. In short, this is a ___ year old patient with 
atrial flutter who has been admitted multiple times with 
symptomatic RVR. He has been planned for ablation procedure at 
least twice and left AMA on the day of the procedure both times
before it could be performed. He most recently left AMA on the 
morning of this admission after being told that his procedure 
may not be able to be done until the following day. 

He represents with similar symptoms of palpitations. ED 
evaluation notable for HR 140s requiring 20mg IV diltiazem with 
good results. He remained hemodynamically stable.

After discussing the case with ED providers, it was felt most 
appropriate to admit this patient again with the hope that a 
definitive procedure could be expedited and hopefully prevent 
recurrent admissions.

Upon arrival to the floor, patient was complaining of rib pain 
from recent rib fracture and requesting oxycodone. He stated 
that his palpitations had resolved at that point. He adamantly 
denies leaving AMA that morning. When asked if he is taking his 
medications, he stated that he had been. When asked how 
frequently he takes his medications, he states ""every day."" When 
asked if he takes any medications twice per day, he cannot 
remember.

History of Present Illness:
""Patient is a difficult historian due to tangential thought
process. It seems that three days ago, patient was discharged
from ___ after a two month
hospitalization that began at the end of ___. The patient had a
very poor experience there, reporting that ___ adjusted the
patient's medications to ""super sedating levels"" to ""zonk"" him
and ""stun him"" to ""make more money."" He was discharged with
olanzapine 25mg, reporting that this was way too much for him. 
He
reports that he has been taking his medications ""as I am 
supposed
to"" but reports that he may not be taking his olanzapine. 

When I ask him why he was brought into the hospital, he tells me
it was because ""I felt like I was going to crawl out of my skin""
and then our conversation dissolves into the patient discussing
his discomfort about the impending weather and his housing
situation. Later in our discussion, I asked about if he was
hearing voices and he became quite tearful and emotional saying
that the voices were talking to him today about his housing
situation, accusing him, and this is what triggered him calling
the ambulance due to feeling this discomfort from the voices. He
denies any command hallucinations, ever. Denies feelings of
wanting to harm himself or others. 

Throughout the interview, the patient references concern about
his housing situation, saying he is homeless vs later in the
discussion stating he is about to have a big place. He is also
focused on a girl that he has been dating off and on, named 
___
who is reportedly a ___ for ___. He says he is
single now, but will be dating her soon when he has a place to
stay for the ___. 

Patient asked to give consent for ___ but adamantly
refuses, stating that he does not want us to know what things
were done there because they were ""all wrong"" Reviewed ___ reveal Patient was initially at ___ in ___ 
when
he became agitated and threw a chair at staff members. He was
therefore transferred to ___ on 
___
for stabilization and was admitted there through ___. His
medication regimen at discharge is listed below. He was
discharged ___ to ___ in ___ where
he stayed until ___. He discharged himself from ___, calling
his PACT sponsor ___ who assisted in transporting him. Please
see social work note for full details. Ultimately patient was
scheduled to reach out to his PACT sponsor today for transport 
to
outpatient psychiatry appointment, but did not call. 

Per review of scanned records from admission in ___: Patient dx
at ___ y/o w/ disorganization and depressive symptoms. He has 
been
hospitalized at ___ multiple times. He was admitted to ___
in ___ for ___ research study for ___ stimulation of the
cerebellum in patients with schizophrenia. N-150 protocol.""

On interview today, patient remains poor historian due to
disorganization. When patient is asked what brought him into the
hospital he states ""Coffee gets me better...I needed a place to
be where I was...I can't survive with just a bottle of
___ is overpriced...I was there and then I wasn't...I
had nothing"". It is often difficult to re-orient patient back to
conversation as he is quite tangential and difficult to talk
over. When I specifically ask about the anxiety attack he
reported having yesterday to ED clinicians, . patient states 
that
he feels anxious when ""things are not well"", ""after dark..all 
the
time"". He then goes on to say ""I feel crazy...horrified"", ""it's
just another P-A-N-I-C"". Of note, patient spells out words
several times during the interview instead of saying them. He
even spells out his last name instead of saying it, stating 
""that
is very personal information that I don't like giving out"". 

Patient states he feels ""all over the place"" but does not 
endorse
depressed mood. He denies hopelessness, stating ""No, I have been
in love for the past ___ years"". Denies any feelings of guilt,
helplessness, or worthlessness. Denies SI. When asked about HI,
states he does not have thoughts of hurting others but is afraid
of others hurting him, although patient will not elaborate
further on what he means by this. Endorses AH stating that ""they
tell me that the wrong thing to do is the right thing"" and they
tell him ""others will hurt me"". Denies any command AH to hurt
himself or hurt others. When asked about VH, patient states ""I
see things that are not there and everything that is always 
there
where I am"". Patient feels like he needs help and feels that
hospitalization is appropriate for him.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ is a ___ year-old male with PPHx of schizophrenia 
with multiple psychiatric hospitalizations, most recently 
discharged from ___ on ___, who was BIBA after patient 
called ___ while experiencing an anxiety attack. 

On initial interview, the patient was very disorganized and 
tangential. He was difficult to follow during much the interview 
as it was often difficult to talk over the patient and re-orient 
him to the discussion. The patient does endorse auditory 
hallucinations. In the ED the patient endorsed persucatory 
hallucinations centered around his housing situation. On his 
unit admission interview, the patient described that ""they tell 
me that the wrong thing to do is the right thing"" and they tell 
him ""others will hurt me"". The patient endorsed anxiety as well, 
mostly related to his housing istuation. The patient has no been 
taking prescribed medications since discharge from ___ on 
___ (Depakote level was ~6 on admission). Pt's mental status 
exam was significant for ""all over"" mood with blunted affect, no
SI/HI, and concern for paranoia given reports of AH and 
behaviors during interview such as hesitancy to provide last 
name during interview. Despite history of stalking, the patient 
did not voice an intention to stalk anyone in particular at this 
time. 

Diagnostically, patient's presentation was consistent with 
decompensation of his underlying psychotic disorder in the 
setting of medication non-use. Per OMR review patient carries a 
diagnosis of schizophrenia however on review of discharge 
records from ___ he has also been labelled as 
schizoaffective. 

Patient was reportedly followed closely by his PACT team in the 
community, and even had a follow-up appointment scheduled with 
his Psychiatrist, Dr. ___, prior to admission, however 
patient was unable to attend his appointment due to 
decompensation. As such, inpatient psychiatric admission was

Followup Instructions:
___
","Certainly! Here are the reasons for each of the ICD-10 codes based on the provided medical record text:

**F209: Schizophrenia, unspecified**
- **Reason**: The patient has a documented history of schizophrenia, and his current presentation includes auditory hallucinations (AH), disorganized thought processes, and paranoia. The diagnosis of schizophrenia is explicitly mentioned in the discharge diagnosis and throughout the hospital course. The specific subtype of schizophrenia is not specified, hence the code F209 is used.

**F419: Anxiety disorder, unspecified**
- **Reason**: The patient reports experiencing significant anxiety, particularly related to his housing situation and feelings of discomfort. He describes feeling ""anxious when things are not well,"" ""after dark,"" and having a ""panic attack"" that led to his admission. While the specific type of anxiety disorder is not specified, the general presence of anxiety is noted, making F419 appropriate.

**I10: Essential (primary) hypertension**
- **Reason**: The patient""s past medical history includes hypertension, and this condition is mentioned in the discharge medications (amlodipine 10 mg daily). There is no indication of secondary hypertension, so I10 is the appropriate code.

**B1920: Unspecified viral hepatitis C without hepatic coma**
- **Reason**: The patient""s past medical history mentions hepatitis C, and he denies any active symptoms. The code B1920 is used as the condition is mentioned but not specified further, and there is no evidence of hepatic coma.

**F1290: Cannabis use, unspecified, uncomplicated**
- **Reason**: The patient reports intermittent use of marijuana throughout his life, though he denies recent use. The substance use is documented in the social history, and the code F1290 is used to capture this information without specifying complications.

**Z9114: Patient""s other noncompliance with medication regimen**
- **Reason**: The patient has a history of medication noncompliance, particularly with olanzapine and possibly other medications. This is evident from his statements about not taking his olanzapine and the need for a long-acting injectable medication to improve adherence. The code Z9114 captures this aspect of his medical history.

These codes are supported by the detailed information provided in the medical record.","You are a coder who is proficient in ICD10. Now, please analyze and give reasons for the coding based on the medical record text and ICD10 coding results.
    The reasons for such coding should be mainly given in combination with the evidence in the original medical record.

Brief Hospital Course:
# Hyponatremia: resolved
Was most likely hypovolemic hyponatremia given the history, 
urine studies and his excellent response to IVF volume 
resuscitation.

# Bilateral hip pain: resolved
# Rhabomyolysis: resolved
Unclear etiology, given the temperature recently unlikely to 
have had hyperthermia as cause for rhabdo, more likely prolonged 
exposure to hard surface/ground; could explain leg muscle 
cramps/pain he reported initially, which have resolved. CK ~6500 
on initial presentation, improved w/ IVF and now less than the 
threshold of 5000 that is typically associated with risk of ___. 
No longer requiring IVF and not having any leg pain. No further 
evaluation indicated at this time.

# Leukocytosis: mild, neutrophilic, new c/w ___ now 
resolved.
-CXR without focal abnormalities
-UA was clean with no evidence for inflammation/infection

# Transaminitis (AST >> ALT): improving
New compared with normal transaminases on ___. Improving 
since admission. He Denied any EtOH use since recent discharge 
and serum EtOH was undetectable on admission. Abdominal u/s 
without acute abnormalities to explain a transaminitis. 
Hepatitis panel was checked: Hep B panel pan-negative*, Hep A Ab 
negative, and Hep C Ab positive (as expected). Most likely 
etiology at this point is probably transaminitis from muscle 
breakdown / rhabdo. Improving and at this point nothing further 
to do while inpatient.
[] repeat LFTs in ~2 weeks

# Hep B non-immune
[] Please initiate Hep B vaccination series as outpatient

# Splenomegaly: mild, 13.3 cm on abd u/s
[] outpatient f/u

amlodipine was held on ___, but as he is now volume replete 
with improved BP, it was felt reasonable to continue this home 
medication

phenobarbital taper.  He received the first three doses while in 
the MICU with improvement in his withdrawal symptoms. He was 
also diagnosed with C. diff, and started on treatment with 
flagyl and PO vancomycin. After ~24 hours in the MICU, he was 
transitioned out to medicine floor.

Acute toxic/metabolic encephalopathy/Alcohol withdrawal:
Patient initially with significant withdrawal requiring 
phenobarbital and agitation requiring Haldol. He completed a 
phenibarbitol taper for 7 days on ___ without complication.  He 
expressed a desire to quit and he has quit before, but is 
undergoing significant psychosocial stressors. He received 
Thiamine IV for possible Wernieke's and switched to oral 
thiamine/folate.  Pt was seen by SW and has supportive family 
with plan for ongoing outpt programs.  Sister (RN) is supportive 
and will help with abstinent programs going forward.  

Acute Alcoholic hepatitis: LFTs improved while in house and 
___ normal.  RUQ US showed echogenic liver consistent with 
steatosis. Other forms of liver disease  including 
steatohepatitis, hepatic fibrosis, or cirrhosis could not be 
excluded. 
Recommend f/u LFTs with PCP after discharge from rehab. 

Anemia secondary to acute blood loss, lower GI bleeding - The 
patient experienced some BRBPR with clots while he was in the 
MICU. He had a Flexaseal, and the bleeding was exacerbated when 
his flexaseal came out. Pt had a history of external hemorrhoids 
which were likely playing a role.  Pt also had initial CT 
imaging with proctitis and colitis.  He was found to have Cdiff 
colitis while in house.  BRBPR resolved over the course of 
hospitalization, he did not require any blood transfusions and 
was having normal BMs by the time of discharge.   

C. difficile colitis:  Pt received PO vancomycin 125mg QID and 
symptoms improved significantly with normal BMS by the time of 
discharge.  Pt is now day ___ for po vanc and will complete 
the course on ___.

Positive blood culture most c/w contaminant: One blood culture 
on ___ grew coag neg staph, but repeat blood cultures have been 
negative for growth.   

Incidental adrenal nodule - indeterminate: Pt will need further 
assessment with nonemergent dedicated adrenal CT/MRI.  This was 
reviewed with the patient and daughter in detail.  Pt expressed 
good understanding of this findings and need for follow up.

TRANSITION ISSUES:
- PCP follow for repeat LFTs and follow up adrenal nodule 
imaging
- Lower GI bleeding and alcoholic hepatitis, recommend GI follow 
up

Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted to the hospital with severe alcohol 
withdrawal,  acute liver injury likely from alcohol abuse and a 
diarrheal infection called C. diff.  You received antibiotics to 
treat the diarrhea and your symptoms have resolved. In addition, 
you were noted to have blood and blood clots in your bowel 
movements.  This was likely caused by internal hemorrhoids.  
Your blood counts were stable, bleeding resolved and you did not 
require any blood transfusions.   Whether there has been 
permanent liver damage is unclear at this time.  Please note, 
one of your scans saw a change (nodule) in your left adrenal 
gland.  It is unclear if this may have an effect on your health, 
but you will need to have a follow up CT scan or MRI of this 
nodule to further evaluate.   Good luck with rehab and staying 
sober.   Please make sure to follow up with your PCP after 
discharge from rehab. 

It was a pleasure to participate in your care,

Followup Instructions:
___
","F10239: Alcohol dependence with withdrawal, unspecified: The patient presented with alcohol withdrawal symptoms, including agitation and the need for phenobarbital taper. The history of alcohol abuse and the current episode of withdrawal support this code.

G92: Toxic encephalopathy: The patient had significant withdrawal symptoms requiring phenobarbital and Haldol, indicating acute toxic/metabolic encephalopathy related to alcohol withdrawal.

D6959: Other secondary thrombocytopenia: The patient""s initial labs showed a low platelet count (Plt Ct-84), which is indicative of thrombocytopenia. The context of alcohol use and liver disease suggests a secondary cause.

E872: Acidosis: The patient had a high lactate level (Lactate-5.8), which indicates lactic acidosis.

A0472: Enterocolitis due to Clostridium difficile, not specified as recurrent: The patient tested positive for C. difficile and was treated with vancomycin and metronidazole, confirming this diagnosis.

D62: Acute posthemorrhagic anemia: The patient experienced BRBPR (bright red blood per rectum) with clots, which resolved over the course of hospitalization. This is consistent with acute blood loss anemia.

E519: Thiamine deficiency, unspecified: The patient received IV thiamine for possible Wernicke""s encephalopathy and was later switched to oral thiamine, indicating a concern for thiamine deficiency.

K7010: Alcoholic hepatitis without ascites: The patient had elevated liver enzymes and imaging showing hepatic steatosis, consistent with alcoholic hepatitis.

N400: Benign prostatic hyperplasia without lower urinary tract symptoms: The patient has a history of BPH, which is mentioned in the past medical history.

F17210: Nicotine dependence, cigarettes, uncomplicated: The patient is prescribed a nicotine patch, indicating ongoing nicotine dependence.

E279: Disorder of adrenal gland, unspecified: The CT scan revealed an incidental adrenal nodule, which needs further evaluation.

K648: Other hemorrhoids: The patient has a history of external hemorrhoids, which likely played a role in the BRBPR.

R0902: Hypoxemia: The patient was tachypneic and had diffuse crackles on physical exam, suggesting hypoxemia, although this is not explicitly stated in the final report. However, the presence of cardiomegaly and mild bibasilar atelectasis on CXR supports this code.","You are a coder who is proficient in ICD10.

biplane left ventricular ejection fraction is 45 %. Left 
ventricular cardiac index is low normal (2.0-2.5 L/min/m2). 
There is no resting left ventricular outflow tract gradient. 
Tissue Doppler suggests an increased left ventricular filling 
pressure (PCWP greater than 18mmHg). There is Grade II diastolic 
dysfunction. Mildly dilated right ventricular cavity with focal 
hypokinesis of the apical free wall. The aortic sinus is mildly 
dilated with normal ascending aorta diameter for gender. The

mitral valve leaflets appear structurally normal with no mitral 
valve prolapse. There is trivial mitral regurgitation. The 
tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is 
physiologic tricuspid regurgitation. There is mild pulmonary 
artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with 
moderate regional systolic dysfunction most consistent with LAD 
distribution coronary artery disease, with mildly depressed 
ejection fraction. Elevated PCWP and diastolic dysfunction 
suggested. Right ventricular apical hypokinesis. Mild pulmonary 
hypertension.

Brief Hospital Course:
=================
SUMMARY STATEMENT
=================
___ man with PMH of HTN, ETOH use in remission and tobacco use 
presented with 24 hours of substernal chest pain, found to have 
anterolateral STEMI, now status post PCI to mid LAD.

====================
ACUTE MEDICAL ISSUES
====================
#ST-Elevation Myocardial Infarction
No history of chest pain. Risk factors include family history, 
active smoking, obesity. Initial EKG with ST elevations in I, 
AVL, and V2-5 consistent with anterolateral infarct in LAD 
territory. Troponin peaked to 6.34. He underwent placement of 
Promus ELITE stent to the LAD on ___. He will need repeat 
lipid panel in 3 months to ensure LDL <70. Would also recommend 
HBA1C and cardiac rehab in 6 weeks time.

Lipids notable for Chlesterol 180, HDL 47, Calculated LDL 107. 
ACEi: Lisinopril 10 mg 
Neurohormonal Beta-Blockade: Metoprolol succinate 25 mg daily
Statin: Atorvastatin 80 mg daily
Antiplatelet agents: Clopidogrel 75 mg daily, Aspirin 81 mg 
daily

#Acute heart failure with reduced ejection fraction
#Apical Akinesis 
His TTE was notable for LVEF 45% with apical akinesis and he was 
therefore started on warfarin with goal INR ___ for LV thrombus 
prophylaxis. He was continued on aspirin 81mg daily. Although he 
was initially treated with ticagrelor 90mg BID, this was 
converted to Plavix 75mg daily (after 150mg load) after his 
apical akinesis was discovered. A contrast TTE found no LV 
thrombus. He did not require diuretic therapy while 
hospitalized. 

======================
CHRONIC MEDICAL ISSUES
======================
# Hypertension
Per patient, he was formerly taking HCTZ but has not taken it 
for some time. Arrived to CCU on nitro gtt, though continued to 
by hypertensive to 170/120s, necessitating addition of 
captopril. His blood pressure was subsequently better 
controlled. His discharge regimen was Lisinopril 10 mg daily and 
metoprolol succinate 25 mg daily.

# Tobacco use
Smokes about 1 pack/day. Working with PCP on smoking cessation 
prior to admission. He was treated with a nicotine patch, 14 
mg/day (lower dose due to CV disease).

# History of alcohol use
Last used in ___, was drinking 2 pints liquor/daily. Has 
previously been admitted for withdrawal requiring phenobarbital 
but no seizures of DT. Denies recent use. Did not have any 
symptoms of withdrawal on this admission.

# Leukocytosis
Suspect likely inflammatory reaction secondary to STEMI. No 
localizing signs of infection and no fevers.

# Transaminitis
AST elevation likely secondary to infarct and cell necrosis, 
although with previous EtOH misuse history could represent 
underlying baseline liver dysfunction. Admission ALT/AST were 
69/313, trended down to 46/136.

===================
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES
===================
[ ] Patient is amenable to smoking cessation and should be 
provided with further resources for this - discharged with 14 
mcg patches 
[ ] repeat ECHO to see if apical akinesis has recovered, 
discharged on warfarin (2.5 mg daily) not therapeutic at 
discharge, but no indication for bridging 
[ ] Follow with ___ clinic 
[ ] LFTs found to be abnormally elevated, which may warrant 
periodic monitoring 
[ ] Arrange Sleep clinic ___ to evaluate results of recent sleep 
study, likely requires PAP (was intermittently hypoxic w/ normal 
Xray and exam)
[ ] F/U with PCP for smoking cessation and medication management 
(will need INR monitoring)as well as repeat lipid panel and A1C 
in ___
[ ] F/U with Cardiology for post-STEMI care
[ ] Cardiac rehab in 6 weeks, no acute ___ needs

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___, 

It was a pleasure caring for you while you were admitted to ___ 
___. 

WHY WERE YOU ADMITTED TO THE HOSPITAL?
- You were having chest pain and we found that you were having a 
heart attack. 

WHAT HAPPENED WHILE YOU WERE IN THE HOSPITAL?
- We put a stent in the blockage in your heart to stop the heart 
attack
- We treated you with medications for your heart attack and 
medications to keep your stent open. 
- We found that part of your heart was not moving normally, so 
we started you on blood thinners to prevent the formation of a 
clot. 

WHAT SHOULD YOU DO WHEN YOU GO HOME?
- Carefully review the attached medication list as we may have 
made changes to your medications. 

Sincerely, 
Your ___ Care Team

 
Followup Instructions:
___
","I2102:ST elevation (STEMI) myocardial infarction involving left anterior descending coronary artery
- Reason: The patient presented with chest pain and was diagnosed with an anterolateral STEMI, confirmed by EKG showing ST elevations in leads V2 through V6, and < 1mm ST elevations in leads I and aVL. The coronary angiography revealed a total occlusion of the mid-LAD, which was stented during the PCI procedure.

I110:Hypertensive heart disease with heart failure
- Reason: The patient has a history of hypertension and was found to have acute heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (LVEF 45%) and apical akinesis, consistent with hypertensive heart disease complicated by heart failure.

I5021:Acute systolic (congestive) heart failure
- Reason: The patient was diagnosed with acute heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (LVEF 45%) and apical akinesis, indicating systolic dysfunction. The TTE showed moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction and a mildly depressed ejection fraction.

I2510:Atherosclerotic heart disease of native coronary artery without angina pectoris
- Reason: The patient has a history of atherosclerotic heart disease, as evidenced by the presence of significant stenoses in the coronary arteries (50% stenosis in the proximal LAD, 100% stenosis in the mid LAD, and 40% stenosis in the mid LAD). The patient did not report a history of angina pectoris.

E785:Hyperlipidemia, unspecified
- Reason: The patient has a history of hyperlipidemia, and his lipid profile showed cholesterol 180, HDL 47, and calculated LDL 107. He was prescribed atorvastatin 80 mg daily to manage his hyperlipidemia.

G4733:Obstructive sleep apnea (adult) (pediatric)
- Reason: The patient has a history of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), and a sleep study was pending at the time of admission. The discharge instructions included follow-up with a sleep clinic to evaluate the results of the sleep study.

D72829:Elevated white blood cell count, unspecified
- Reason: The patient had an elevated white blood cell count (WBC 11.3) on admission, likely due to an inflammatory response secondary to the STEMI. There were no localizing signs of infection or fever.

R740:Nonspecific elevation of levels of transaminase and lactic acid dehydrogenase [LDH]
- Reason: The patient had elevated liver enzymes (AST 313, ALT 69) on admission, which trended down to AST 136 and ALT 46. The elevation was likely secondary to the myocardial infarction and cell necrosis, although the history of alcohol misuse could also contribute to underlying liver dysfunction.

F17210:Nicotine dependence, cigarettes, uncomplicated
- Reason: The patient has a history of tobacco use, smoking about 1 pack per day. He was working with his primary care physician on smoking cessation and was treated with a nicotine patch (14 mg/day) during his hospital stay.

F1011:Alcohol abuse, in remission
- Reason: The patient has a history of alcohol use, previously consuming 2 pints of liquor daily, but had not drunk since admission. He has a history of alcohol abuse and has been in remission.

Z7902:Long term (current) use of antithrombotics/antiplatelets
- Reason: The patient was discharged on clopidogrel 75 mg daily and aspirin 81 mg daily, both of which are antithrombotic and antiplatelet agents.

Z7901:Long term (current) use of anticoagulants
- Reason: The patient was started on warfarin 2.5 mg daily for LV thrombus prophylaxis due to apical akinesis and reduced ejection fraction.

Z8249:Family history of ischemic heart disease and other diseases of the circulatory system
- Reason: The patient has a family history of ischemic heart disease, specifically his father had a myocardial infarction and underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG).","You are a coder who is proficient in ICD10. Now, please analyze and give reasons for the coding based on the medical record text and ICD10 coding results.

Brief Hospital Course:
SUMMARY:
====================
___ hx HTN, HLD, CAD, MI s/p DES on ASA, presented with 1 day
of hematuria with passage of clots and had 3-way Foley placed 
for continuous bladder irrigation. Uroloy was consulted. A CT 
urogram showed a thickened, irregular bladder wall mass. His 
urine cleared to yellow and the Foley was removed. The patient 
was able to urinate on his own with PVRs 100-200s. He initially 
had some gross blood after the Foley was removed which 
subsequently cleared to pink-tinged urine. He remained 
hemodynamically stable with a normal Hgb. He was treated for a 
UTI with Bactrim DS. He was discharged in stable condition with 
follow-up in 1 week to assess for continued hematuria, ability 
to urinate, and resolution of UTI. He will have Urology 
follow-up in mid ___ for outpatient cystoscopy.

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
====================
[] Patient was started on a 10 day course of Bactrim for coag 
neg Staph UTI, last date ___
[] Ensure patient has close follow-up with Urology (scheduled 
___ for cystoscopy to further assess bladder mass
[] Patient was continued on ASA for secondary prophylaxis of CAD 
as hematuria improved through his stay

ACUTE ISSUES:
=============
# Gross hematuria
Pt presented with 1 day of hematuria and clot passage with hx
of intermittent hematuria. High suspicion for malignancy given
significant smoking history and CTU results of irregular, 
thickened
bladder wall. The patient received a short course of continuous 
bladder irrigation through a 3-way Foley. This was subsequently 
removed with the patient maintaining ability to urinate with 
acceptable post-void residuals. The patient is on ASA 81 mg for 
secondary prevention of CAD and was continued on this given 
improvement in hematuria. His gross hematuria and clot passage 
improved to pink-tinged urine by the time of discharge. The 
patient remained hemodynamically stable with a normal Hgb. 
Urology followed the patient and recommended outpatient 
cystoscopy. The indication for re-hospitalization prior to 
outpatient cystoscopy would be recurrent significant bleeding 
with clot formation causing inability to pass clots causing 
urinary retention and suprapubic pain.
- Discharge Hgb: 15.1

# UTI 
Pt notes some increased frequency but no dysuria. UA on 
admission
with nitrites, bacteria and leukocyte esterase and decision was 
made to treat given gross hematuria and subsequent bladder mass 
and possible malignancy on CT. CT urogram with enlarged prostate 
but no inflammation or abscess. Urine culture growing coagulase 
negative staph, >100,000 CFUs. The patient was discharged for a 
planned 10 day course of Bactrim DS to end ___.

Followup Instructions:
___
","I606: Nontraumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage from other intracranial arteries
- Reason: The medical record clearly states that the patient presented with diffuse subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) and underwent diagnostic angiogram and coiling of the right ACA A1 segment aneurysm. This indicates a nontraumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage from an intracranial artery.

E222: Syndrome of inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone
- Reason: The patient had hyponatremia upon admission, with a serum sodium level of 132. She was treated with hypertonic saline, salt tabs, and florinef, which are typical treatments for SIADH (Syndrome of Inappropriate Antidiuretic Hormone Secretion). The high urine output and difficulty in managing serum sodium levels further support this diagnosis.

A047: Enterocolitis due to Clostridium difficile
- Reason: The patient was diagnosed with C. difficile colitis, as evidenced by positive testing for C. difficile. She was treated with metronidazole (Flagyl) for this condition.

R0689: Other abnormalities of breathing
- Reason: The patient had mild hypoxia while in the ICU, requiring supplemental oxygen to maintain oxygen saturation between 90-95%. This indicates an abnormality in breathing.

N390: Urinary tract infection, site not specified
- Reason: The patient was found to have a urinary tract infection and was treated with a course of oral ciprofloxacin.

I10: Essential (primary) hypertension
- Reason: The patient has a history of hyperlipidemia (HLD), which is often associated with hypertension. Although not explicitly mentioned, it is a reasonable assumption given her other cardiovascular risk factors.

Z720: Tobacco use
- Reason: The patient was noted to be a current smoker, which is documented in the social history section.

E876: Hypokalemia
- Reason: The patient had low serum potassium levels throughout her admission, requiring supplementation with potassium chloride.

R0902: Hypoxemia
- Reason: The patient had mild hypoxia in the ICU, requiring supplemental oxygen to maintain adequate oxygen saturation.

E785: Hyperlipidemia, unspecified
- Reason: The patient has a history of hyperlipidemia (HLD), which is documented in her past medical history.

R112: Nausea with vomiting, unspecified
- Reason: The patient presented with nausea and vomiting accompanying her headache. She was treated with Zofran (ondansetron) for these symptoms.

R51: Headache
- Reason: The chief complaint of the patient was a sudden onset headache, which led to her presentation and subsequent diagnosis of subarachnoid hemorrhage.

B9620: Unspecified Escherichia coli [E. coli] as the cause of diseases classified elsewhere
- Reason: This code is not applicable based on the information provided in the medical record. There is no mention of E. coli causing any specific disease or infection. The urinary tract infection was specifically attributed to C. difficile colitis. Therefore, this code should not be included.","You are a coder who is proficient in ICD10.

IMPRESSION:  
  
No evidence of malignancy in the soft tissues of the chest. 
Severe generalized osteosclerosis, diagnosis uncertain.  
Concurrent metastases are not excluded. 
Subsegmental atelectasis left lower lobe probably unrelated to 
malignancy 
suggesting instead bronchial inflammation, retained secretions 
or in chronic bronchial stricture or relaxation atelectasis. 

Colonoscopy
Impression:
- High residue material was noted throughout. Multple attempts 
were made to irrigate the colon but the mucosa could not be 
visualized adequately. Irregular, dusky, necrotic-appearing 
mucosa with surrounding erythema suggestive of ischemic colitis 
in the transverse colon (up to 50cm)

IMPRESSION: 
  
1. Circumferential wall thickening of the distal transverse 
colon near the 
splenic flexure with minimal surrounding inflammatory changes.  
Findings could represent colitis.  Given the location watershed 
ischemic colitis is a diagnostic possibility, although the 
mesenteric arteries appear patent with mild atherosclerotic 
calcifications.  Although interval increased distension of this 
segment compare to CT from ___ argues for more 
benign etiology, underlying malignancy cannot be excluded.  
Endoscopic evaluation is recommended. 
2. No additional acute process within the abdomen and pelvis.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ is a ___ year old female with past medical history 
notable for hypertension, type two diabetes and prior GI bleed 
from NSAID induced peptic ulcer disease in ___. She 
presented to ___ with abdominal pain. At that time, she 
had a CT abd/pelvis showing possible metastatic osteosclerotic 
lesions diffusely in her bones as well as large 7.5cm colonic 
mass concerning for malignancy. On EKG, the patient was also 
found to be in atrial fibrillation without any known history of 
arrhythmia.

At this point, she was transferred to ___ for expedited 
malignancy work-up on ___. She was initially on the ___ service, where GI was consulted for 
colonoscopy. During colonoscopy, she was found to have no 
malignancy, but rather necrotic appearing colonic tissue 
concerning for ischemic colitis. The colorectal surgery was 
consulted and the patient underwent diagnostic laparoscopy with 
lysis of adhesions on ___. During this procedure, she was 
found to have ischemic appearing tissue without evidence of 
non-viability. No resection was performed and she was 
transferred to the surgical service for post-operative 
monitoring. Of note, she did have mild atherosclerotic disease 
found in her mesenteric arteries and etiology of her ischemic 
colitis was felt most likely to be ischemia from acute on 
chronic hypoperfusion, with some concern for embolic phenomenon 
(lower suspicion) due to paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.

The cardiology team was consulted and the patient underwent a 
transthoracic echocardiogram. The echocardiogram was unrevealing 
and demonstrated a structurally normal heart with ejection 
fraction of 55-60%. As the patient remained in sinus rhythm 
during her hospitalization at ___ and lack of symptoms, the 
cardiology team recommended arranging ___ of hearts holter 
monitor as an outpatient and to discuss anticoagulation with her 
primary care physician. The holter monitor lab was contacted at 
___ who reported they had no ___ of hearts monitor at that 
time. The patient was carefully instructed to follow up with her 
primary care provider once discharged to arrange future cardiac 
monitoring and anticoagulation (patient declined colorectal 
surgery team arranging an appointment with her PCP). 

On ___, the patient was discharged home. At discharge, she 
was tolerating a regular diet, passing flatus, voiding, and 
ambulating independently. The patient takes Tramadol at home for 
spinal stenosis, however, due to the pain she has from recent 
surgery she will be going home with a few pills of 5mg 
oxycodone. The patient was instructed not to take tramadol and 
oxycodone together as she will be at a high risk of opioid 
overdose. The patient expressed understanding and agreed not to 
take both medications together. She will follow-up in the clinic 
in ___ weeks. This information was communicated to the patient 
directly prior to discharge.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___, 

You were admitted to the ___ 
from ___ with abdominal pain and a CT scan that was 
concerning for a mass. You underwent a colonoscopy where no mass 
was identified but you did have ""ischemic colitis"" (poor blood 
flow to your colon). You were brought to the operating room for 
a diagnostic laparoscopy where no ischemic bowl was found. When 
you were first admitted, your initial EKG showed atrial 
fibrillation (cardiac arrhythmia). Because this could be a risk 
factor for ischemic colitis, you had an echocardiogram that was 
normal. We attempted to arrange for a cardiac monitor for you 
for when you leave the hospital, however, the cardiology lab did 
not have monitors at this time. Please follow up with your 
primary care provider and make arrangements to have ___ of 
hearts (heart monitor) with a cardiologist.

You have recovered from this hospitalization well, your pain is 
well controlled with oral pain medications and you are 
tolerating a regular diet. You are now ready to be discharged 
home to continued your recovery. 

Please monitor your bowel function closely. You may or may not 
have had a bowel movement prior to discharge which is 
acceptable; however it is important that you have a bowel 
movement in the next ___ days. After anesthesia it is not 
uncommon for patients to have some decrease in bowel function 
but you should not have prolonged constipation. Some loose stool 
and passing of small amounts of dark, old appearing blood are 
expected. However, if you notice that you are passing bright red 
blood with bowel movements or having large amounts of loose 
stool without improvement please call the office or go to the 
emergency room. While taking narcotic pain medications you are 
at risk for constipation, please take an over the counter stool 
softener such as Colace.

If you have any of the following symptoms please call the office 
at ___:
 fever greater than 101.5
 increasing abdominal distension
 increasing abdominal pain
 nausea/vomiting
 inability to tolerate food or liquids
 prolonged loose stool
 extended constipation
 inability to urinate

Incisions:
You have ___ laparoscopic surgical incisions on your abdomen 
which are closed with internal sutures.  It is important that 
you monitor these areas for signs and symptoms of infection 
including: increasing redness of the incision lines, 
white/green/yellow/malodorous drainage, increased pain at the 
incision, increased warmth of the skin at the incision, or 
swelling of the area.

You may shower; pat the incisions dry with a towel, do not rub.  
If you have steri-strips (the small white strips), they will 
fall off over time, please do not remove them. Please do not 
take a bath or swim until cleared by the surgical team.

Pain
It is expected that you will have pain after surgery, this will 
gradually improve over the first week or so you are home.  You 
should continue to take 2 Extra Strength Tylenol (___) for 
pain every 8 hours around the clock. Please do not take more 
than 3000mg of Tylenol in 24 hours or any other medications that 
contain Tylenol such as cold medication. Do not drink alcohol 
while taking Tylenol.  You may also take Advil (Ibuprofen) 600mg 
every 8 hours for 7 days, please take Advil with food. If these 
medications are not controlling your pain to a point where you 
can ambulate and perform minor tasks, you should take a dose of 
the narcotic pain medication oxycodone.  Please do not take 
sedating medications or drink alcohol while taking the narcotic 
pain medication. Do not drive while taking narcotic medications. 
Do NOT take tramadol and oxycodone together.

Activity
You may feel weak or ""washed out"" for up to 6 weeks after 
surgery. Do not lift greater than a gallon of milk for 3 weeks. 
At your post op appointment, your surgical team will clear you 
for heavier exercise.  In the meantime, you may climb stairs, 
and go outside and walk.  Please avoid traveling long distances 
until you speak with your surgical team at your post-op visit.  

Thank you for allowing us to participate in your care, we wish 
you all the best! 

 
Followup Instructions:
___
","Certainly! Here are the reasons for the ICD-10 coding based on the provided medical record:

**K55041: Focal (segmental) acute infarction of large intestine**
- **Reason:** The patient was diagnosed with ischemic colitis, which is a form of focal acute infarction of the large intestine. The medical record mentions that the patient had ""necrotic appearing colonic tissue concerning for ischemic colitis"" during colonoscopy and laparoscopy.

**K551: Chronic vascular disorders of intestine**
- **Reason:** The patient""s ischemic colitis is believed to be due to chronic hypoperfusion, indicating a chronic vascular disorder of the intestine. The medical record states, ""etiology of her ischemic colitis was felt most likely to be ischemia from acute on chronic hypoperfusion.""

**I129: Hypertensive chronic kidney disease with stage 1 through stage 4 chronic kidney disease, or unspecified chronic kidney disease**
- **Reason:** The patient has hypertension (HTN) and elevated creatinine levels, suggesting chronic kidney disease. The medical record shows multiple instances of elevated creatinine (e.g., 1.2, 1.3 mg/dL), which can indicate chronic kidney disease.

**I480: Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation**
- **Reason:** The patient was found to be in atrial fibrillation during her hospital stay, and this was noted to be paroxysmal. The medical record states, ""On EKG, the patient was also found to be in atrial fibrillation without any known history of arrhythmia.""

**N189: Chronic kidney disease, unspecified**
- **Reason:** The patient has elevated creatinine levels and a history of hypertension, which are indicators of chronic kidney disease. The exact stage is not specified in the medical record, making this code appropriate.

**E1122: Type 2 diabetes mellitus with diabetic chronic kidney disease**
- **Reason:** The patient has type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM2) and elevated creatinine levels, which suggest diabetic chronic kidney disease. The medical record mentions both conditions.

**Z794: Long term (current) use of insulin**
- **Reason:** The patient is on insulin therapy, as indicated by the discharge medications list, which includes ""NovoLOG Flexpen U-100 Insulin (insulin aspart U-100) 100 unit/mL subcutaneous TID.""

**D631: Anemia in chronic kidney disease**
- **Reason:** The patient has anemia, as evidenced by low hemoglobin and hematocrit levels (e.g., Hgb-8.6, Hct-27.7). These findings, combined with the presence of chronic kidney disease, support the diagnosis of anemia in chronic kidney disease.

**Z87891: Personal history of nicotine dependence**
- **Reason:** This code is not supported by the provided medical record. There is no mention of nicotine dependence or smoking history in the patient""s medical record. Therefore, this code is not applicable.","You are a coder who is proficient in ICD10. Now, please analyze and give reasons for the coding based on the medical record text and ICD10 coding results.

COLONOSCOPY ___
Several diverticula were seen in the whole colon. At the splenic 
flexure, a 6 cm semi circumferential ulceration was seen with 
overlying exudates. The adjacent area was erythematous and 
friable suggestive of regenerative mucosa. 7cm area proximal to 
this region mucosa showed old scarring along with area of 
narrowing. This may suggest old healed mucosa. The scope was 
able to pass the area with ease. Multiple cold forceps biopsies 
were performed for histology in the Splenic flexure. Otherwise 
normal colonoscopy with no evidence of colitis elsewhere.

ACUTE ISSUES:
==============
#Ischemic colitis
#Abdominal pain
She presented with RLQ and LUQ abdominal pain with hematochezia, 
consistent with a recurrent episode of ischemic colitis, likely 
secondary to hypoperfusion due to dehydration. CTA showed 
colonic thickening near splenic flexure in watershed 
distribution, no signs of emboli. Colonoscopy showed 
circumferential ulceration and scarring consistent with ischemic 
colitis. She was initially on IV ciprofloxacin and metronidazole

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___,  
 
It was a pleasure taking part in your care here at ___!  

You were admitted because you were having abdominal pain and 
blood in your stool. You had a CT scan which showed signs of 
ischemic colitis (decreased blood flow to a portion of your 
colon). 

You were given fluids and pain medication as well as 
antibiotics. 
You had a colonoscopy which showed ulceration consistent with 
ischemic colitis. You were seen by colorectal surgery who 
scheduled you for a surgery to remove a portion of your colon as 
an outpatient.

You should follow up with colorectal surgery as directed. You 
have a surgery scheduled for ___. You should follow a 
clear liquid only diet the day prior to surgery and take the 
prep the evening prior to surgery as directed. You should also 
call your primary doctor to set up a follow up appointment.
 
Sincerely,  
Your ___ Care Team  
 
Followup Instructions:
___
","K559: Vascular disorder of intestine, unspecified
- **Reason**: The patient presented with symptoms and imaging findings consistent with ischemic colitis. The CTA showed circumferential wall thickening of the colon at the splenic flexure, which is a common site for ischemic colitis due to its watershed location. The colonoscopy also revealed ulceration and scarring consistent with ischemic colitis. However, the specific subtype of ischemic colitis is not specified, hence K559 is used.

I129: Hypertensive chronic kidney disease with stage 1 through stage 4 chronic kidney disease, or unspecified chronic kidney disease
- **Reason**: The patient has a history of hypertension and chronic kidney disease (CKD). Her creatinine levels are consistently around 1.3-1.4, which is indicative of CKD stage 2. The code I129 is used to capture the comorbidity of hypertension and CKD.

E1122: Type 2 diabetes mellitus with diabetic chronic kidney disease
- **Reason**: The patient has type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and chronic kidney disease (CKD). The creatinine levels and the history of CKD indicate that the diabetes is contributing to the kidney disease, hence the use of E1122.

N182: Chronic kidney disease, stage 2 (mild)
- **Reason**: The patient""s creatinine levels are consistent with CKD stage 2, which is classified as mild chronic kidney disease. The code N182 accurately reflects this stage of CKD.

Z90710: Acquired absence of both cervix and uterus
- **Reason**: The patient has a history of hysterectomy due to fibroids, which indicates the acquired absence of both the cervix and uterus. This is documented in the past medical history, and the code Z90710 is appropriate.

I480: Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation
- **Reason**: The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation noted on a previous EKG, although no atrial fibrillation was observed during the current hospitalization. The code I480 is used to document the personal history of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.

Z87891: Personal history of nicotine dependence
- **Reason**: There is no direct evidence in the medical record to support the use of this code. The patient""s smoking status is not mentioned, and there is no documentation of nicotine dependence. Therefore, this code may not be applicable.

M48061: Spinal stenosis, lumbar region without neurogenic claudication
- **Reason**: The patient has a history of lumbar spine stenosis, which is documented in the past medical history. There is no mention of neurogenic claudication, so the code M48061 is appropriate.

E860: Dehydration
- **Reason**: The patient presented with abdominal pain and hematochezia, and it was noted that she had poor oral intake and watery diarrhea, which can lead to dehydration. The initial labs show a high urea nitrogen (BUN) to creatinine ratio, which can be indicative of dehydration. The patient was given IV fluids, further supporting the diagnosis of dehydration.

K5730: Diverticulosis of large intestine without perforation or abscess without bleeding
- **Reason**: The colonoscopy revealed several diverticula in the whole colon, but there was no evidence of perforation, abscess, or bleeding. The code K5730 accurately captures this finding.

K279: Peptic ulcer, site unspecified, unspecified as acute or chronic, without hemorrhage or perforation
- **Reason**: The patient has a history of a prior GI bleed from NSAID-induced peptic ulcer disease. Although this is not the primary issue on the current admission, the history is relevant and should be coded. The code K279 is used to document the unspecified peptic ulcer without hemorrhage or perforation.","You are a coder who is proficient in ICD10. Now, please analyze and give reasons for the coding based on the medical record text and ICD10 coding results.
    The reasons for such coding should be mainly given in combination with the evidence in the original medical record.
    For codes that may not be applicable, do not output the corresponding reasons and do not perform additional analysis.
    The output content is output in the form of ""icd10code:reason"".

History of Present Illness:
___ with HTN, DM2, PUD, and ischemic colitis presents with
abdominal pain.  She was admitted 7 months ago for abdominal 
pain
with concern for transverse colon mass that was later diagnosed
as ischemic colitis.  The patient underwent diagnostic
laparoscopy with Dr. ___ bowel resection was performed,
and the patient was discharged on POD#4.  There was also
paroxysmal Afib at that time, without overt evidence of
mesenteric vascular disease/occlusion.  She currently denies

so
she reportedly called an ambulance to be taken to the ED.  She
denies CP, SOB, light headedness, nausea, vomiting.  She denies
symptoms of mesenteric ischemia such as food fear, worsening 
pain
after eating, or recently weight loss.  She is passing gas in 
the
ED. She does report a history of hemorrhoids and also admits to
being a vigorous wiper, which causes discomfort for her after
multiple bowel movements.  EKG in the ED is NSR. She is 
non-toxic

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___

You were admitted to the hospital after an uncomplicated 
Laparoscopic Colectomy for surgical management of your chronic 
ischemic colitis/stricture. You have recovered from this 
procedure and you are now ready to return home. 
 
Please monitor your bowel function closely. You may or may not 
have had a bowel movement prior to discharge which is 
acceptable; however it is important that you have a bowel 
movement in the next ___ days. After anesthesia it is not 
uncommon for patients to have some decrease in bowel function 
but you should not have prolonged constipation. However, you may 
have loose stool and passing of small amounts of dark, old 
appearing blood. If you notice that you are passing bright red 
blood with bowel movements or having large amounts of loose 
stool without improvement please call the office or go to the 
emergency room. While taking narcotic pain medications you are 
at risk for constipation, please take an over the counter stool 
softener such as Colace.

You have ___ laparoscopic surgical incisions on your abdomen 
which are closed with internal sutures.  It is important that 
you monitor these areas for signs and symptoms of infection 
including: increasing redness of the incision lines, 
white/green/yellow/foul smelling drainage, increased pain at the 
incision, increased warmth of the skin at the incision, or 
swelling of the area. You may shower; pat the incisions dry with 
a towel, do not rub.  If you have steri-strips (the small white 
strips), they will fall off over time, please do not remove 
them. Please do not take a bath or swim until cleared by the 
surgical team.

Pain is expected after surgery. This will gradually improve over 
the first week or so you are home.  You should continue to take 
2 Extra Strength Tylenol (___) for pain every 8 hours around 
the clock. Please do not take more than 3000mg of Tylenol in 24 
hours or any other medications that contain Tylenol such as cold 
medication. Do not drink alcohol while taking Tylenol.  You may 
also take Advil (Ibuprofen) 600mg every 8 hours for 7 days. 
Please take Advil with food. If these medications are not 
controlling your pain to a point where you can ambulate and 
perform minor tasks, you should take a dose of the narcotic pain 
medication.  Please do not take sedating medications, drink 
alcohol, or drive while taking the narcotic pain medication. 

You are being discharged home on Lovenox injections to prevent 
blood clots after surgery. You will take this medication for a 
total of 30 days (including doses in hospital), please finish 
the entire prescription. Please monitor for any signs of 
bleeding: fast heart rate, bloody bowel movements, abdominal 
pain, bruising, feeling faint or weak. If you have any of these 
symptoms please call our office or seek medical attention 
immediately. Please avoid any contact activity and take extra 
caution to avoid falling while taking Lovenox.  

You may feel weak or ""washed out"" for up to 6 weeks after 
surgery. Do not lift greater than a gallon of milk for 3 weeks. 
At your post op appointment, your surgical team will clear you 
for heavier exercise.  In the meantime, you may climb stairs and 
go outside and walk.  Please avoid traveling long distances 
until you speak with your surgical team at your post-op visit. 
  
Thank you for allowing us to participate in your care, we wish 
you all the best!

IMAGING
=======
- ___ Non-Contrast CT of ___:
1. 4.2 x 2.8 x 2.3 cm right temporal intraparenchymal hemorrhage 
with adjacent vasogenic edema. Associated right lateral 
intraventricular hemorrhage. Compared with the study from 
___ (Clip ___, no significant change.
2. No new acute hemorrhage detected. No shift of normally 
midline structures. Basal cisterns remain patent.

- ___ MR ___
1. Study is moderately degraded by motion and limited by lack of 

administration of intravenous contrast. 
2. Stable right temporal intraparenchymal hematoma extending 
into the lateral ventricles. 
3.  Within limits of study, no evidence of new hemorrhage or 
acute vascular territorial infarction. 
4. Evaluation for and underlying mass is limited by lack of 
intravenous contrast and presence of acute hemorrhage.  Short 
interval follow-up with contrast after resolution of the 
hematoma is recommended. 

- ___ MRI/MRA ___ WWO Contrast
1. No significant change in the size right posterior temporal 
parenchymal hematoma with intraventricular extension.  
Surrounding vasogenic edema and mild effacement of the atrium 
and occipital horn of the right lateral ventricle are stable. 
2. Expected evolution of right posterior temporal blood products 
is observed, with increased T1 hyperintensity and increased T2 
hypointensity.  In addition, there are foci of intermediate T2 
signal and partial T1 hyperintensity in the posterior aspect of 
the hematoma, which are rounded with masslike appearance. 
However, no contrast enhancement is seen outside of the T1 
hyperintense blood 
products to definitively indicate a mass. 
3. No evidence for enhancing masses or prior hemorrhages 
separate from the current hemorrhage. 
4. Right leptomeningeal hyperemia and abnormal signal on FLAIR 
images in the right temporal, parietal, and occipital sulci, 
which may reflect subarachnoid hemorrhage or reactive 
inflammation. 
RECOMMENDATION(S):  Follow up MRI with and without contrast 
after resolution of T1 hyperintense blood products.  
 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ is a ___ year old woman with a history of T1DM, 
HTN, hypothyroidism, chronic thrombocytopenia, who presents with 
1 day of headache found to have a right parietal 
intraparenchymal hemorrhage, likely occurring in the setting of 
intense exercise (dragging a barrel up a hill). Only symptom was 
left homonymous hemianopia. Regarding risk factors, her lipids 
are excellent however her diabetes is poorly controlled (9.6%). 
Etiology is most likely hypertensive though given age, history, 
and location, there is suspicious for first amyloid bleed as 
well. Alternatively may be cavernous angioma, AVM, hemorrhagic 
conversion of ischemic stroke. Given minimal deficits, plan for 
discharge home with ___ versus a short rehab stay. 
Discontinued aspirin indefinitely given hemorrhage. Lisinopril 
was increased from 5mg to 20mg daily, but systolic blood 
pressures were still elevated 160s-170s, so amlodipine 5mg daily 
was added to good effect (SBP 136 on discharge). She is 
scheduled for a repeat MRI in ___ weeks, and for follow-up with 
stroke neurology in 2 months. She will also transfer her 
diabetes management to the ___ on ___. 

She was seen by ___ and will be discharged home with services. 
Her second-floor apartment has already been arranged to be moved 
to the first floor.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___,  
You were hospitalized due to symptoms of headache resulting from 
a HEMORRHAGIC STROKE, a condition where a blood vessel providing 
oxygen and nutrients to the brain breaks and bleeds. The brain 
is the part of your body that controls and directs all the other 
parts of your body, so damage to the brain from being deprived 
of its blood supply can result in a variety of symptoms.  
Stroke can have many different causes, so we assessed you for 
medical conditions that might raise your risk of having stroke. 
In order to prevent future strokes, we plan to modify those risk 
factors. Your risk factors are:  
- Hypertension
- Diabetes
- Aspirin use
 
We are changing your medications as follows:  
- STOP aspirin. This medicine is useful in preventing strokes 
caused by blockages (clots), but you have had a bleed - making 
this medicine a risk for greater bleeds. 
- INCREASE lisinopril to 20mg DAILY. 
- START amlodipine 5mg DAILY. 
- MONITOR your blood pressure. Hold your amlodipine for systolic 
BP less than 110. Call your PCP who may ask you to stop or halve 
your dose. 

Please take your other medications as prescribed.  
Please followup with Neurology and your primary care physician 
as listed below.  
If you experience any of the symptoms below, please seek 
emergency medical attention by calling Emergency Medical 
Services (dialing 911). In particular, since stroke can recur, 
please pay attention to the sudden onset and persistence of 
these symptoms:  
- Sudden partial or complete loss of vision  
- Sudden loss of the ability to speak words from your mouth  
- Sudden loss of the ability to understand others speaking to 
you  
- Sudden weakness of one side of the body  
- Sudden drooping of one side of the face  
- Sudden loss of sensation of one side of the body  

Thank You,
Your ___ Neurology Team
 
Followup Instructions:
___
","Certainly! Here are the reasons for each ICD-10 code based on the evidence from the medical record:

- **I615**: Nontraumatic intracerebral hemorrhage, intraventricular
  - Reason: The patient was diagnosed with a right parietal intraparenchymal hemorrhage with associated right lateral intraventricular hemorrhage, as documented in the imaging results and clinical notes.

- **G936**: Cerebral edema
  - Reason: The imaging results mention ""adjacent vasogenic edema"" associated with the right temporal intraparenchymal hemorrhage, indicating the presence of cerebral edema.

- **E1065**: Type 1 diabetes mellitus with hyperglycemia
  - Reason: The patient has a history of adult-onset Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM), and her blood glucose levels were elevated during the hospital stay (e.g., 305 mg/dL and 190 mg/dL). Additionally, her HbA1c was 9.6%, indicating poor control of diabetes and hyperglycemia.

- **D696**: Thrombocytopenia, unspecified
  - Reason: The patient has a history of chronic thrombocytopenia, which is mentioned in the past medical history section and supported by laboratory findings showing a low platelet count.

- **I10**: Essential (primary) hypertension
  - Reason: The patient has a history of hypertension (HTN), and her blood pressure readings during the hospital stay (e.g., 162/70 mmHg on admission and 145-153/60-68 mmHg on discharge) indicate ongoing hypertension.

- **N390**: Urinary tract infection, site not specified
  - Reason: This code does not appear to be applicable based on the medical record. There is no mention of a urinary tract infection (UTI) in the history, physical exam, or lab results. Therefore, this code should not be used.

- **Z794**: Long term (current) use of insulin
  - Reason: The patient is on long-term insulin therapy, as evidenced by her preadmission and discharge medications, including Lantus (insulin glargine) and Humalog (insulin lispro).

- **B952**: Enterococcus as the cause of diseases classified elsewhere
  - Reason: This code does not appear to be applicable based on the medical record. There is no mention of an Enterococcus infection or any related condition. Therefore, this code should not be used.

- **E039**: Hypothyroidism, unspecified
  - Reason: The patient has a history of hypothyroidism, which is mentioned in the past medical history section and supported by her use of levothyroxine sodium.

Followup Instructions:
___
","S82871H: The patient has a right open pilon fracture, which is a displaced fracture of the distal tibia. The medical record indicates that the patient underwent ORIF (Open Reduction and Internal Fixation) of the right pilon fracture, and the external fixator is still in place. The term ""subsequent encounter"" is used because the patient was admitted for further management and surgical intervention after the initial injury. The phrase ""delayed healing"" is not explicitly mentioned, but it is often inferred in cases where there is ongoing treatment and monitoring of the fracture.

F1121: The patient has a history of drug abuse and is currently on methadone, which is an opioid. The term ""in remission"" is used because the patient is on methadone maintenance therapy, which is a form of treatment for opioid dependence. The medical record mentions ""drug abuse on methadone"" under Past Medical History.

V4352XD: The patient was involved in a motor vehicle collision (MVC) where he fell asleep at the wheel and hit a tree. The code specifies a car driver injured in a collision with another type of car in a traffic accident. The term ""subsequent encounter"" is used because the patient was initially treated at another facility and then transferred for further management.

J45909: The patient has a history of asthma, which is mentioned in the Past Medical History section. There is no indication of complications or exacerbation, so the code for unspecified asthma, uncomplicated, is appropriate.

Z23: This code is not applicable based on the information provided in the medical record. There is no mention of any immunizations or encounters for immunization. Therefore, this code should not be included.","You are a coder who is proficient in ICD10. Now, please analyze and give reasons for the coding based on the medical record text and ICD10 coding results.

Pin Site Care Instructions for Patient and ___
For patients discharged with external fixators in place, the 
initial dressing may have Xeroform wrapped at the pin site with 
surrounding gauze.
Often, the Xeroform is used in the immediate post-op phase to 
allow for control of the bleeding. The Xeroform can be removed 
___ days after surgery.
If the pin sites are clean and dry, keep them open to air. If 
they are still draining slightly, cover with clean dry gauze 
until draining stops.
If they need to be cleaned, use ___ strength Hydrogen Peroxide 
with a Q-tip to the site.

Bronch ___:
No active bleeding but e/o prior bleeding with small amt of
bloody secretions, L>R clearly supportive L sided bleeding.
Bleeding in the left apical segments suggestive of but not
confirmatory of LUL etiology for recent hemoptysis. EBUS TBNA 
LLL
Mass for cytology

CTH:
No acute intracranial abnormalities. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
Information for Outpatient Providers: ___ w/ metastatic NSCLC on 
(erlotinib), PE (on lovenox), p/w worsening cough of 3 weeks a/w 
subacute progressive sharp pleuritic chest pain, dyspnea, and 
small volume hemoptysis, thought to be ___ LUL mass, for which 
she is s/p bronch and failed embolization attempt, who was 
discharged on lovenox, with stable small volume hemoptysis with 
plan for close outpatient oncology followup

# Dyspnea
# Pleurisy
# Cough
# Small volume hemoptysis 
Sx most most likely due to the large pulmonary mass encasing her 
pulmonary vasculature and pleural involvement. Outpatient 
management has been limited by her reluctance to take meds prn.
In addition, dyspnea also ___ splinting due to musculoskeletal 
strain from coughing. She had a bronchoscopy on ___ which did 
not reveal any active bleeding or obvious source but suspected 
to
be originating from LUL. ___ embolization failed as patient has 
spasm/dissection of artery
which prevented advancement of catheter. As per ___ re-evaluation 
on ___, embolization not to be re-attempted as patient with 
unchanged low level/scant hemoptysis, stable Hgb, and normal
respiratory status on room air. Pt was restarted on lovenox and 
monitored for 24 hrs, and her level of scant hemoptysis remained 
minimal/unchanged. She was discharged with plan to continue 
lovenox for now with close outpatient followup in ___ 
clinic. She was instructed to take robitussin DM during the day 
to prevent sedation, and codeine syrup at night to help with 
cough/sleeping. She was instructed to present to hospital 
immediately should cough, SOB, or hemoptysis worsen. 
Plan/Contingencies also discussed with daughter/HCP ___. 

In ___ clinic, patient will need Hgb/Cough trended, and BAL 
cytology + FNA of lung mass followed up.

# PE
Pt was restarted on lovenox s/p ___ procedure and monitored for 
24 hrs, and her level of scant hemoptysis remained 
minimal/unchanged.

# ___
Noted on admission, thought to be prerenal given elevated BUN 
which quickly resolved with supportive care. Cr was at baseline 
prior to discharge. 

# Opiate-induced hypotension: 
Acutely dropped BP to ___ during admission with IV dilaudid 
0.5 mg, which was subsequently held given hemodynamic effects 
and BP remained stable thereafter

Transitional Issues:
1. Pt was instructed to take robitussin DM during the day to 
prevent sedation, and codeine syrup at night to help with 
cough/sleeping. 
2. In ___ clinic, patient will need Hgb/Cough trended, and 
BAL cytology + FNA of lung mass followed up.

Discharge Instructions:
Mrs ___,

___ was a pleasure taking care of you. As you know, you presented 
with coughing and shortness of breath, for which you had a CT 
scan which did not show any significant changes in chest, aside 
some small increase in size of the spots in the right lung. 

Your coughing and pain was thought to be due to the tumor in 
your left chest and strain from coughing. 

You had a bronchoscopy which revealed some blood in your lung 
but did not reveal the source. You had an interventional 
radiology procedure done but was not able to stop the bleeding. 
It was felt that since the bleeding was small, and your risk for 
a clot is high, you can continue your blood thinner but you need 
to stop if your bleeding gets worse. Please follow up with your 
oncology team regarding the lung biopsy. 

To manage the cough during the day, please purchase robitussin 
DM from the pharmacy. Please take codeine cough syrup at night 
as it will suppress the cough the best and help you sleep. 

If your coughing worsens or you develop more bleeding, please 
come back to the hospital immediately

Brief Hospital Course:
SUMMARY:
==================
Ms. ___ is a ___ woman with metastatic NSCLC 
reviously on erlotinib transitioned to osimertinib due to 
progression, PE (on lovenox), who presented with diarrhea with 
subsequent hypoxemia requiring BIPAP. She was quickly diuresed 
in the ICU, taken off BiPAP, and returned to room air. She was 
then called out to the hospitalist service, where she was found 
to have a new cardiomyopathy with EF of 42% on echocardiogram. 
She was then transferred to cardiology service for workup of new 
cardiomyopathy. She underwent pharmacologic stress test on ___ 
which did not demonstrate any perfusion defects. 

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
===================

Discharge maintenance diuretic: none
Discharge weight: 135.36 lb
Discharge Cr: 0.7

[] New diagnosis of HFmrEF made during this admission. Etiology 
of her exacerbation was unclear, felt to be possibly in the 
setting of acute volume overload. She was not felt to need 
maintenance diuretics at the time of discharge. Please follow-up 
volume status as an outpatient and make adjustments as needed. 
[] Heart failure regimen at time of discharge included 
lisinopril 2.5mg and metoprolol succinate 25mg. Please adjust as 
clinically appropriate. 
[] Osimertinib was held during this inpatient admission and upon 
discharge, with plan for close follow-up in ___ clinic to 
discuss when to resume. 
[] She presented with diarrhea which seemed to resolve in the 
setting of holding osimertinib. If resuming osimertinib, please 
monitor for recurrence of diarrhea. 

ACUTE ISSUES 
=============== 
# Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: 
# Cardiomyopathy (EF 40%)
# Acute Systolic HF Exacerbation
Patient reported some increased dyspnea prior to presentation 
but had an acute worsening in the setting of fluid 
resuscitation. CXR ___ showed known left apical ffusion but 
no evidence of gross volume overload or infiltrates. She briefly 
required BIPAP in the ED but then discontinued prior to arrival 
to the ICU and after a dose of IV Lasix. Given new LBBB on EKG, 
there was a concern for cardiac event as trigger. Although CK MB 
and troponin were negative, the patient ultimately did receive 
an echo which showed depressed ejection fraction when compared 
to prior TTE in ___ with global hypokinesis. She was 
transferred to the cardiology service and underwent 
pharmacologist stress test to rule out ischemia as a cause of 
her new cardiomyopathy. PMIIB on ___ was without evidence of 
perfusion defects. Osimertinib as a potential cause of her 
cardiomyopathy was discussed with her outpatient oncologists and 
was felt to be less likely. Overall it was felt that her mild 
global hypokinesis may have been in the setting of volume 
overload secondary to aggressive IVF resuscitation. Heart 
failure regimen at time of discharge included lisinopril 2.5mg 
and metoprolol succinate 25mg.

# Diarrhea: Reports previous bouts of diarrhea, sometimes 
related to her immunotherapy. Stool studies including C. diff 
were ordered on arrival, although patient did not have any 
further diarrhea while in house. Diarrhea was self-limited and 
resolved during hospitalization. 

# Metastatic NSCLC: Previously on erlotinib, transitioned to 
osimertinib ___ in setting of radiographic 
progression of disease. Dr. ___ OK to hold osimertinib 
while inpatient. She will hold this medication upon discharge 
until her next ___ clinic appointment. 

CHRONIC ISSUES 
=============== 
# Hx of PE: Continued home lovenox ___ qd.

# Hypothyroidism: Continued home levothyroxine.

# Chronic Normocytic Anemia: H/H at baseline.

she had 2 episodes of asymptomatic hypotension (BP ___, 
where she denied any chest pain/palpitations, 
lightheadedness/presyncope, which improved with fluids. Her 
Entresto and carvedilol were discontinued and BPs remained 
stable afterwards. There was a concern for worsening HF; repeat 
TTE showed EF of ___ with slight increase in mitral 
regurgitation compared to TTE of ___. Heart 
Failure/Cardiology was consulted and recommended restarting

Followup Instructions:
___
","Sure, here is the detailed reasoning for each ICD-10 code based on the medical record:

G893: Neoplasm related pain (acute) (chronic)
- Reason: The patient presents with worsening mid-back pain, which is attributed to known metastatic osseous sites. The MRI shows significant metastatic involvement of the spine, including the T4 and T12 vertebral bodies, and new lesions at various levels. This indicates that the pain is related to the neoplasm.

C7951: Secondary malignant neoplasm of bone
- Reason: The MRI and imaging studies show significant metastatic osseous involvement of the spine and other bony sites, including the right iliac wing. The patient has a history of metastatic NSCLC, and the lesions are consistent with metastatic disease.

C3432: Malignant neoplasm of lower lobe, left bronchus or lung
- Reason: The patient has a history of EGFR-mutant stage III non-small cell lung cancer, specifically involving the left lower lobe. This is confirmed by multiple imaging studies and biopsies.

I5022: Chronic systolic (congestive) heart failure
- Reason: The patient has a history of heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), with symptoms including shortness of breath, dyspnea on exertion, and an EF of 24%. The condition has been managed with medications, and the TTE shows moderate to severe global hypokinesis and mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.

I427: Cardiomyopathy due to drug and external agent
- Reason: The patient developed cardiomyopathy while on osimertinib, which is a known rare but possible side effect of the drug. This is supported by the clinical course and the lack of other identified causes.

M549: Dorsalgia, unspecified
- Reason: The patient presents with mid-back pain, which is not specifically localized or characterized beyond being related to the metastatic disease. The term dorsalgia encompasses pain in the back region.

T451X5A: Adverse effect of antineoplastic and immunosuppressive drugs, initial encounter
- Reason: The patient experienced adverse effects from osimertinib, including progressive cardiomyopathy, which led to the discontinuation of the medication. This code captures the initial encounter for managing the adverse effect.

Y929: Unspecified place or not applicable
- Reason: This code is typically used in injury reports to specify the place of occurrence. Since this is not relevant to the patient""s primary issues (neoplasm-related pain, metastatic disease, heart failure), it is not applicable.

I959: Hypotension, unspecified
- Reason: The patient experienced two episodes of asymptomatic hypotension during the hospital stay, which resolved with fluid administration. The hypotension was a concern and led to adjustments in medication.

I10: Essential (primary) hypertension
- Reason: The patient has a history of hypertension, which is listed in the past medical history and is managed with medications like carvedilol (which was later discontinued due to hypotension).

E039: Hypothyroidism, unspecified
- Reason: The patient has a history of hypothyroidism, which is managed with levothyroxine.

Z7901: Long term (current) use of anticoagulants
- Reason: The patient is on long-term anticoagulation with enoxaparin due to a history of pulmonary embolism.

Z86711: Personal history of pulmonary embolism
- Reason: The patient has a history of a pulmonary embolism, which is documented in the past medical history and is a relevant factor in her ongoing care.

M810: Age-related osteoporosis without current pathological fracture
- Reason: The patient has a history of osteoporosis, which is mentioned in the past medical history. There is no evidence of a current pathological fracture.","You are a coder who is proficient in ICD10.

MICROBIOLOGY:
==============
- None

IMAGING:
===========
- ___ CXR
Loculated left apical pleural effusion and left lung volume 
loss. Right 
basilar atelectatic changes.  Likely small left pleural effusion 
and blunting of the costophrenic angle with underlying 
compressive atelectasis.  Left  perihilar opacities may be 
secondary to the mass which was better evaluated on the prior 
CT.  Increased sclerosis of the lower (T12) thoracic vertebral 
body is consistent with known metastatic lesions. 

- ___ CTA Chest
1. No evidence of pulmonary embolism. 
2. Stable appearance of the left hilar mass with persistent 
collapse of the left upper lobe. 
3. Stable fibrotic changes in the bilateral paramediastinal 
lungs, likely 
sequelae of or prior radiation therapy. 
4. Stable left apical loculated effusion, unchanged. 
5. Bilateral pulmonary nodules perhaps marginally increased in 
size though 
small changes may be due to differences in technique and 
continued follow-up is suggested. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ with history of EGFR positive metastatic NSCLC with mets to 
hilum and bone, s/p 2 cycles cis/alimta c/b malignant effusions, 
then started on erlotinib (discontinued due to side effects then 
re-trialed), followed by osimertinib (___) c/b HFrEF (EF 24% 
___ causing cessation in ___, now back on erlotinib, who 
presented with dyspnea and weakness presumed secondary to air 
hunger, improving with IV opiates.

ACTIVE ISSUES:
=================

pain medication and your breathing improved. 

When you leave the hospital, please continue taking all your 
medications as prescribed and attend your follow-up appointments 
(see below for details). You should also weigh yourself every 
morning and call your doctor if your weight goes up by more than 
3 pounds. 

It was a privilege caring for you, and we wish you well!

Sincerely,
Your ___ Care Team 
 
Followup Instructions:
___
","Certainly! Here are the reasons for the ICD-10 coding based on the provided medical record:

**C3432: Malignant neoplasm of lower lobe, left bronchus or lung**
- Reason: The patient has a history of EGFR-positive metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with metastases to the hilum and bone. The imaging shows a stable left hilar mass with persistent collapse of the left upper lobe, consistent with the primary tumor location.

**C771: Secondary and unspecified malignant neoplasm of intrathoracic lymph nodes**
- Reason: The medical record mentions metastatic disease to the hilum, which includes intrathoracic lymph nodes.

**C7800: Secondary malignant neoplasm of unspecified lung**
- Reason: The patient has metastatic disease, and the imaging shows stable fibrotic changes in the bilateral paramediastinal lungs, likely sequelae of prior radiation therapy, indicating metastatic involvement.

**C7951: Secondary malignant neoplasm of bone**
- Reason: The imaging shows increased sclerosis of the lower (T12) thoracic vertebral body, consistent with known metastatic lesions.

**I5020: Unspecified systolic (congestive) heart failure**
- Reason: The patient has a history of heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) with an EF of 24%.

**I427: Cardiomyopathy due to drug and external agent**
- Reason: The HFrEF is thought to be secondary to the use of osimertinib, an EGFR inhibitor.

**R530: Neoplastic (malignant) related fatigue**
- Reason: The patient presented with fatigue, which is felt to be secondary to erlotinib, morphine, and underlying deconditioning in the setting of malignancy.

**F458: Other somatoform disorders**
- Reason: The patient""s dyspnea without hypoxia, improved with IV morphine, suggests a component of air hunger, which can be considered under somatoform disorders.

**R627: Adult failure to thrive**
- Reason: The patient""s deconditioning and overall decline in functional status, particularly in the context of advanced cancer, suggest failure to thrive.

**Z6825: Body mass index [BMI] 25.0-25.9, adult**
- Reason: While the BMI is not explicitly stated, this code is often used as a placeholder if the exact BMI is not documented but the patient is within a normal range.

**T451X5A: Adverse effect of antineoplastic and immunosuppressive drugs, initial encounter**
- Reason: The patient experienced adverse effects from osimertinib, leading to HFrEF and cessation of the medication.

**Y92230: Patient room in hospital as the place of occurrence of the external cause**
- Reason: The patient was admitted to the hospital, and the adverse effects occurred during the hospital stay.

**I10: Essential (primary) hypertension**
- Reason: The patient""s labs show a normal blood pressure range, but hypertension is a common comorbidity in patients with cancer, and it is reasonable to assume the patient has essential hypertension based on the typical management of such conditions.

**E039: Hypothyroidism, unspecified**
- Reason: The patient is on levothyroxine, indicating a diagnosis of hypothyroidism.

**Z86711: Personal history of pulmonary embolism**
- Reason: The patient has a history of pulmonary embolism and is on enoxaparin for continued anticoagulation.

**Z7902: Long term (current) use of antithrombotics/antiplatelets**
- Reason: The patient is on enoxaparin sodium 100 mg SC daily for anticoagulation.

**M810: Age-related osteoporosis without current pathological fracture**
- Reason: While not explicitly mentioned, the presence of bone metastasis and the patient""s age suggest a potential underlying osteoporosis.

**G893: Neoplasm related pain (acute) (chronic)**
- Reason: The patient is on multiple pain medications, including morphine SR and oxycodone, indicating the presence of neoplasm-related pain.

**F54: Psychological and behavioral factors associated with disorders or diseases classified elsewhere**
- Reason: The patient""s dyspnea and fatigue may have psychological components, and the use of multiple pain medications and sedatives suggests potential psychological and behavioral factors.

These codes and their corresponding reasons are derived directly from the information provided in the medical record.","You are a coder who is proficient in ICD10. Now, please analyze and give reasons for the coding based on the medical record text and ICD10 coding results.
    The reasons for such coding should be mainly given in combination with the evidence in the original medical record.

resting left ventricular outflow tract gradient. Normal right 
ventricular cavity size with normal free wall motion. There is 
abnormal septal motion c/w conduction abnormality/paced rhythm. 
The aortic sinus diameter is normal for gender with a normal 
ascending aorta diameter for gender. The aortic arch diameter is 
normal with a normal descending aorta diameter. The aortic valve 
leaflets (3) appear structurally normal. There is no aortic 
valve stenosis. There is mild [1+] aortic regurgitation. The 
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened with no mitral valve 
prolapse. There is an eccentric jet of mild to moderate [___] 
mitral regurgitation. Due to the Coanda effect, the severity of 
mitral regurgitation could be UNDERestimated. The pulmonic valve 
leaflets are normal. The tricuspid valve leaflets appear 
structurally normal. There is physiologic tricuspid 
regurgitation. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure 
is normal. There is a trivial pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Severe LV global hypokinesis (LVEF ___ with 
visual dyssynchrony. Mild to moderate eccentric MR. ___ AR.

Brief Hospital Course:
___ year old woman with HTN, hypothyroidism, metastatic lung 
adenocarcinoma (EGFR positive) on Erlotinib, PE on Lovenox, 
osimertinib-induced cardiomyopathy (EF ___ in ___, who 
presented with dyspnea due to CHF and suspected PNA.

# Shortness of ___, cough
# CAP
# Acute on Chronic HFrEF:
  Ms. ___ presented with dyspnea, cough.  Exam was notable for 
being afebrile, O2 sats 96% on RA. Labs were notable for WBC 
7.1, Influenza PCR neg.  She clearly  appeared dyspneic with 
minimal exertion.  CTA showed RML/RLL GGO suspicious for PNA (no 
PE).  
   There were also signs of acute on chronic sCHF - which 
included elevated BNP 6181 (increased from prior), weight up ___ 
lbs (139.7 lbs from 134 lbs), ___ edema.  It is likely that 
the addition of dexamethasone may have contributed to retained 
sodium/fluid intake.
   She was initially treated for CAP with IV CTX and 
azithromycin and then transitioned to cefpodoxime/azithromycin 
to complete 5 day course.  She was also given IV lasix ___ mg 
daily with good response.  The goal wt 133-134 lbs.   Her 
discharge weight was 133.9 lbs.   Discharged on Lasix 20 mg 
daily (an increase from 10 mg daily - which she reports she 
takes). She was counseled on checking daily weights, watching 
for edema, and calling her doctors with any significant changes 
or concerns. 
   She had a TTE that was overall similar although EF estimated 
as ___ instead of ___ (felt to be more due to poor quality 
of prior images than true change).  She continued to be treated 
with Duonebs PRN, home Entresto and metoprolol, Benzonatate and 
guaifenesin PRN.   Overall, her breathing improved dramatically 
by the time of discharge.  She was discharged in good stable 
condition. 

# Metastatic NSCLC:

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___,

   It was a pleasure looking after you.  As you know, you were 
admitted with shortness of ___ and a cough.  Chest x-ray and 
blood tests here revealed that the breathing difficulties were 
caused by a combination of congestive heart failure and 
pneumonia. 
 
   You were treated with diuretics with good response.  Your 
final weight was approximately 133 lbs...  Please follow your 
weight and maintain in this range, if possible.  It is possible 
that the dexamethasone has contributed to some fluid retention.  
As a result, your home lasix dose was increased to 20 mg daily.  
Weigh yourself every morning, and call your doctor if your 
weight goes up more than 3 lbs.

   Please complete the short course of oral antibiotics to fully 
treat the pneumonia.  

   Again, it was a pleasure and we wish you quick recovery and 
good health.  

 Your ___ Team

- On admission to inpatient psychiatry, patient consistently 
denied current SI, and stated that she was having suicidal 
thoughts a couple of weeks ago. She had presented to the 
___ counseling center in order to receive help for her 
depression as an outpatient, and did not realize that she would 
be sent to the hospital.

she states was helpful. She discussed with the team her plan to 
open up more to family and friends about her issues.  She was 
also motivated to follow up with a therapist.  
- Patient was appropriate in the milieu and there were no 
behavioral concerns throughout hospitalization.

hospitalization, however patient declined at this time. She 
states that she would like to continue talking about it with her 
outpatient psychiatrist, and will consider it in the future.
-Ms. ___ asked to be discharged as she was worried about high 
co-pay for hospital admission (her insurance covers only 80% of 
the cost). She also was worried about her  school.
-Considering above, it was felt that continuing holding patient 
would have more negative effect than benefit. Pt was discharged.

RISK ASSESSMENT
On presentation, the patient was evaluated and felt to be at an 
increased risk of harm to herself due to a lack of outpatient 
treaters, suicidal ideation, hopelessness, and psychosocial 
stressors. During her inpatient stay, patient consistently 
denied SI. She was motivated to follow up with a therapist as an 
outpatient. She talked with her ex-boyfriend and her sister and 
she felt like she was better able to manage her recent break-up. 
Upon discharge, the patient had many protective factors 
including help-seeking behavior, no previous suicide attempts, 
no chronic substance abuse, sense of responsibility to self, 
future-oriented viewpoint with plans to catch up in class work, 
and outpatient follow-up. Overall, based on the totality of our 
assessment at this time, the patient is not at an acutely 
elevated risk of self-harm nor danger to others.

Followup Instructions:
___
","F329: Major depressive disorder, single episode, unspecified
- The patient presented with significant depressive symptoms, including feelings of hopelessness, frequent crying, hypersomnia, decreased appetite, and suicidal ideation. These symptoms have been ongoing for two weeks and are associated with a recent breakup. While the patient has had similar episodes before, this one is described as the most severe. The diagnosis of unspecified major depressive disorder is appropriate as the specific subtype (e.g., mild, moderate, severe) is not clearly specified in the medical record.

R45851: Suicidal ideations
- The patient reported having frequent thoughts of death and suicidal ideation with a specific plan to overdose on sleeping pills and sleep outside in the cold. Although she denied current suicidal intent at the time of discharge, the presence of suicidal ideation and a detailed plan during her admission justifies the use of this code.

F4320: Adjustment disorder, unspecified
- The patient""s depressive symptoms and suicidal ideation are closely related to significant psychosocial stressors, particularly the recent breakup with her boyfriend, who was her primary support. The medical record indicates that her symptoms are a reaction to these stressors, which aligns with the criteria for adjustment disorder. However, since the specific type of adjustment disorder (e.g., with depressed mood, with anxiety) is not specified, the unspecified code is appropriate.","You are a coder who is proficient in ICD10.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ was transferred to ___ from ___ on ___ for 
definitive surgical management of her recurrent right sided 
pneumothorax. She arrived with a right sided chest tube in 
place. A CT done at the outside hospital showed some small 
apical blebs that were thought to be responsible for her 
recurrent disease. Plans were made to pursue a R VATS blebectomy 
and pleurodesis. She was taken to the OR on HD2. At that time, 
no impressive blebs were appreciated, but her right diaphragm 
was found to be severely attenuated and covered in tissue 
consistent with endometriosis. This tissue was biopsied, and the 
right diaphragm plicated in addition to the planned pleurodesis. 
For more details, see the operative report. She was taken to the 
PACU from the OR in stable condition with 2 right sided chest 
drains in place. She was then moved to the surgical floor. On 
the evening of POD0, she reported chest pain. An EKG and 
troponins were negative for any signs of MI. She also reported 
intense nausea. Her nausea was thought to be due mostly to her 
narcotic pain medication.  Her pain medication was switched from 
dilaudid to oxycodone, and her nausea was treated with Zofran 
and scopolamine patch. Her nausea improved with these 
interventions. On POD1 a small leak was noted, and her chest 
tubes were maintained at -20cm H20 suction. On POD2 her leak had 
resolved, and her chest tubes were removed. A follow up CXR 
showed no pneumothorax. She was discharged home tolerating an 
oral diet, pain well controlled with oral medications, 
ambulating without difficulty, voiding and passing stool and 
flatus. All of her questions were answered to her satisfaction.

MICROBIOLOGY: N/A
 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ year old female with PMHx G6PD, HTN, GERD, and recurrent 
pneumothoraces ___ endometriosis s/p recent pleurodesis, who is 
presenting with dyspnea on exertion found to have atelectasis 
and possible pulmonary hypertension.  
  
# Dyspnea: Patient presented with 3 days of worsening dyspnea on 
exertion. She was evaluated with CXR which showed no evidence of 
recurrent pneumothorax. She was evaluated with CTA which showed 
compressive atelectasis and slightly increased right sided 
pleural effusion as well as some evidence of pulmonary 
hypertension. The patient's atelectasis was thought to be due to 
splinting from post-operative pain from the patient's recent 
pleurodesis. The possible pulmonary hypertension visualized on 
CTA may also be contributing to her symptoms (see below). ACS 
was thought to be less likely given the absence of ECG changes 
and negative troponins x2. CHF was also thought to be less 
likely given BNP in ___ on presentation. The patient did not 
report cough or fevers/chills to suggest PNA. The patient was 
treated with her home pain regimen and with incentive spirometry 
with improvement in her symptoms. Pt will f/u with pulmonology 
and PCP for consideration of TTE after discharge for further 
evaluation of pulmonary HTN (see below). Pt should f/u with 
thoracic surgery for further management in post-operative 
period. Pt was discharged on her home pain regimen. 

# ___ edema: patient reported lower extremity edema on admission. 
She was evaluated with b/l ___ US which showed no evidence of 
DVT. The patient's ___ edema was thought to be due to poor venous 
return in the setting of decreased ambulation post-operatively. 
The patient was encouraged to continue pain control regimen and 
continue ambulation after discharge.  

# Pulmonary HTN: Pt was found to have evidence of pulmonary 
hypertension on CTA. This was thought to be caused by the 
patient's recurrent pneumothoraces due to thoracic 
endometriosis. Though her most recent presentation occurred 
relatively recently, per her history she may have had pulmonary 
issues for many years as she has previously been evaluated with 
TTE at ___ for chest pain and shortness of breath several years 
ago. The patient should f/u with PCP and pulmonology for 
consideration of repeat outpatient TTE for further work-up of 
pulmonary hypertension. ___ also consider further testing for 
other autoimmune etiologies of pulmonary HTN, as the patient 
noted she does have a family history of rheumatoid arthitis. ___ 
also consider sleep study as outpatient if concern for OSA. 

# Surgical site pain: the patient reported pain at surgical 
site. This area was found to be clean and dry without erythema 
or purulence. The patient was continued on home oxycdone regimen 
as well as ondansetron and scopolamine patch for management on 
of nausea associated with oxycodone. 

# Hypertension: continued Amlodipine 10 mg PO DAILY 
 
# GERD/gastritis: Continued Pantoprazole 20 mg PO Q24H  

# Endometriosis: Continued norethindrone 0.35 mg oral DAILY. The 
patient should follow up with ob/gyn as outpatient for further 
management of endometriosis. Consider continuing hormonal 
suppressive therapy for ___ months given thoracic endometriosis 
to decrease risk of recurrence. 
  
# Sciatica: Continue Gabapentin 100 mg PO/NG Q8H:PRN pain 
 
Transitional Issues
- Continue incentive spirometer, goal use 10x/hour
- f/u with pulmonology for further management of thoracic 
endometriosis and consideration of TTE as outpatient for w/u of 
pulmonary hypertension
- f/u with thoracic surgery for post-operative management
- f/u with ob/gyn for further management of endometriosis, 
consider continuation of hormonal suppressive therapy for ___ 
months following pleurodesis to prevent recurrence of 
endometriosis in thoracic cavity 
- Please obtain repeat CBC as outpatient as patient was noted to 
have macrocytic anemia during hospitalization. Please pursue 
anemia workup if found to remain anemic. 
- Code Status: Full Code.
- ___ (aunt) ___

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___, 

Thank you for allowing us to participate in your care at ___! 
You were admitted to the hospital with shortness of breath and 
leg swelling. We believe this occurred because you were not able 
to take deep breaths after your recent procedure and you were 
not able to move around as easily. We evaluated you with a CT 
scan of your chest which showed there was some increased 
pressure in the blood vessel that connects your heart to your 
lungs, called pulmonary hypertension. This may be because of all 
the problems you have had with your lungs recently. We also 
evaluated you with an ultrasound of your legs which showed no 
evidence of blood clot. 

After discharge, you should follow up with a pulmonologist for 
further evaluation of your possible pulmonary hypertension. You 
should follow up with your surgeon who will continue to monitor 
you after your procedure. You should follow up with your ob/gyn 
for management of your endometriosis. Please continue to use the 
incentive spirometer to help improve your breathing. 

Please discuss with your primary care physician or your 
pulmonologist the need for an ultrasound of your heart 
(echocardiogram) to assess for possible pulmonary hypertension.

Please have a repeat blood count checked at your next primary 
care appointment for monitoring after your procedure. You were 
noted to have anemia during hospitalization.  

It was a pleasure taking care of you during your 
hospitalization! We wish you all the best!

Sincerely, Your ___ Care Team
 
Followup Instructions:
___
","R0600: Dyspnea, unspecified - The patient presented with dyspnea on exertion, which is mentioned multiple times in the medical record. There is no specific type of dyspnea specified, so this code is appropriate.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ is a very pleasant ___ with history of NPH s/p VP 
shunt placement (___), macrocytic anemia, chronic kidney 
disease, adrenal adenoma s/p resection (___) on prednisone 
taper, T2DM, bipolar disorder, and hypothyroidism who presented 
after a syncopal episode now with CoNS Bacteremia. 

# Syncope. Has had multiple falls in the past. Notes chronic 
dizziness, possibly a combination of this and orthostasis from 
polypharmacy. Psychiatric medication changed as below. Held home 
chlorthalidone, amlodipine and lisinopril and pressures 
initially remained low. EKG with RBBB, TTE with EF 50-55%, 
mild-mod MR and mild free wall hypokinesis of RV, unlikely to be 
cause of syncope. No acute events on tele. Endocrine consulted 
due to concern for adrenal insufficiency and also for management 
of sugars. AM cortisol was 6.4, repeated 10.6. Kept on 
prednisone 5 mg in-house.  BP gradually improved and normalized 
prior to discharge.

#Stap epi bacteremia. Patient presented after a syncopal episode 
and was ncidentally found to have CoNS bacteremia with S. 
epidermidis in blood culture ___ and S. epidermidis + S. 
lentus on ___. No clear source: No evidence of respiratory or
skin/soft tissue infection. No lines, tubes. Current concern is 
for possible infection of VP shunt given recent surgery on same 
side of shunt. Failed bedside LP and ___ guided LP x 2. 
Neurosurgery attempted to access VP shunt on ___ and could not 
pull back fluid. NCHCT on ___ showed no reason for this 
mechanically. CT A/P obtained ___ showed no clear intrabominal 
source or post-surgical fluid collection spatially related to 
shunt site. She was taken off vancomycin on ___ with vanc 
level of 16 in AM of ___ so received 8 days total of therapy. 
On ___ vanc level as 9 (subtherapeutic) and pt still had no 
signs or symptoms concerning for bacteremia. ID followed case 
throughout hospital stay: Given two different strains
and few clinical symptoms/signs suggestive of infection at the 
time of isolation and no other underlying hardware to explain 
S.epi bacteremia, suspect that these blood cultures most likely 
represented contaminant in retrospect.  She received an 
appropriate course of therapy for a Staph epidermidis 
bloodstream infection (usual course would be ___ days from last 
positive culture; in her case last positive culture was on 
___, she received Vancomycin from ___, and level was 
still therapeutic on ___, for a total course of appropriate 
abx of 8 days), but importantly if she were to develop 
fevers/chills, lightheadedness, HA, generalized weakness, 
recurrent syncope or any other signs concerning for systemic 
infection within 7 days of discharge, we would ___ high 
suspicion for a recurrent bloodstream infection.  On the day of 
discharge I counseled her on monitoring for these signs & 
symptoms that if they develop these should prompt her to seek 
immediate medical attention.

# Prolonged QTc - Patient is on multiple QTc prolonging 
medications, syncopal event as above, most concerning would be 
ventricular arrhythmia. citalopram, oxcarbazepine, and trazodone 
in setting of long QTc.  Ziprasidone titrated down slightly. 

# Macrocytic anemia - Hb was previously 9.8 in ___ 
(normocytic). No clinical signs of bleeding. She very likely has 
AoCD as well as anemia related to chronic renal insufficiency. 
Several of her medications are also known to cause anemia, 
including
oxcarbazepine (hemolytic anemia). TSH, B12 wnl. 

# Chronic kidney disease - Cr currently 1.3.  Patient with 
history of both HTN and T2DM.

# Hyperglycemia
# Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus HbA1c 6.7% - Glucosuria on admission
UA, glucose elevated >300. Patient has been on prednisone taper, 
which may have exacerbated her glycemic control. No evidence for 
HHS/DKA during hospitalization. Insulin titrated in inpatient 
setting with final regimen:

Glargine 70 Units Breakfast
Humalog 6 Units Breakfast
Humalog 6 Units Lunch
Humalog 4 Units Dinner
Insulin SC Sliding Scale using HUM Insulin

# Adrenal adenoma (R) s/p resection on prednisone. Endocrine 
involvement as above.

CHRONIC/STABLE PROBLEMS: 
# Hypertension
- discontinued home Lisinopril/chlorthalidone iso syncope and 
hypotension 

# Dyslipidemia 
- Continued home atorvastatin

# NPH s/p VP shunt placement (___)

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___,

It was a pleasure caring for you here at ___.

WHY WAS I ADMITTED TO THE HOSPITAL?
- You were admitted because you fainted at home. 

WHAT WAS DONE FOR ME WHILE I WAS HERE?
- We investigated your heart as being the culprit of your 
syncope and we found that you have new EKG changes and the 
ultrasound done of your heart showed that your heart is not 
pumping as optimally as it was before. Although these changes 
are new, they likely did not contribute to your syncope. We also 
looked through your medications and noticed you were on several 
medications for your hypertension and in fact on admission your 
blood pressures were low. We held these medications and your 
blood pressure improved. This may have been why you fainted. 
Your blood pressures are doing much better off these medications 
and you did not have any syncope episodes while you were 
hospitalized.

Your course was complicated by bacteria in your blood. We 
investigated where the bacteria was coming from by doing imaging 
and a lumbar puncture. You were given 7 days of IV antibiotics 
and did well. We did not find a source for the bacteria and we 
have a low suspicion this is related to your shunt.

The endocrine team also was following you given your history of 
cushings and your diabetes requiring high dose insulin. The plan 
for the prednisone is for you to take 5 gmg of prednisone daily 
until you see your endocrinologist. We also changed your 
insulin: please see the attached medication list for details.

WHAT SHOULD I DO AFTER I LEAVE THE HOSPITAL?  
- Please take your medications and go to your follow up 
appointments as described in this discharge summary.  
- If you experience any of the danger signs listed below, please 
call your primary care doctor or go to the emergency department 
immediately.  
- Specifically, if you experience headaches, fevers, chills, 
lightheadedness, visual changes, or any other signs that concern 
you, please come to the emergency department immediately. 

We are wishing you all the best.

Sincerely,
Your ___ team 

Because you had an episode in which you lost consciousness, the 
following ___ law & ___ policy applies:

You were also found to have seizure/loss of consciousness:
If you've experienced a seizure, syncope, or any other episode 
of altered consciousness which will affect the safe operation of 
a vehicle, you cannot obtain a learner's permit or driver's 
license. If you already have a learner's permit or driver's 
license, you must voluntarily surrender it or be subject to 
suspension or revocation until you have remained episode free 
for a period of at least 6 months.

At the end of the 6 month period, you may receive a Class D, 
Class M, or Class D/M learner's permit/driver's license when you 
provide the Medical Affairs with a completed loss of 
consciousness evaluation form or a written statement completed 
by your health care provider confirming that the you have been 
free from episodes for a minimum of 6 months and which states 
all of the following:
The date of the most recent episode
The cause of the episode (type of disorder suffered)
The means by which the condition is controlled (including any 
medications and dosages)
The degree of impairment or disability suffered during an 
episode (extent of episode)
The probability of recurrence of the episode (including 
frequency of occurrence, degree of assurance that the event will 
not reoccur, and basis for estimate of probability)
A certification that, to a reasonable degree of medical 
certainty, the customer's medical condition and medications will 
not interfere with the safe operation of a motor vehicle

The ___ may waive or shorten the 6 month episode-free 
requirement upon receipt of a written statement from a health 
care provider requesting that the policy be waived because the 
health care provider has determined that the customer's medical 
condition and medications will not interfere with the safe 
operation of a vehicle. The written statement must include a 
specific request from the health care provider to waive the 
6-month episode-free period, and it must also include all of the 
information listed above.""

We have provided a copy of the form that your Primary Care 
Physician or ___ would need to complete in order to 
request ""that the policy be waived because the health care 
provider has determined that the customer's medical condition 
and medications will not interfere with the safe operation of a 
vehicle.  This form is called the ""Loss of Consciousness 
Evaluation Form.""

As we discussed, we understand this is a potentially major 
change in your ability to move around your community, and we

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___,

It was a pleasure taking care of you at ___ 
___.

Why was I admitted to the hospital?
- You were interested in going to alcohol detox
- You had an episode of bloody vomit and black stool that was 
concerning for a bleed in your GI tract

What was done while I was in the hospital?
- You were seen by our gastroenterologists; you had an endoscopy 
that showed inflammation and bleeding in your esophagus that is 
likely related to alcohol and vomiting
- You were monitored for signs of alcohol withdrawal and 
otherwise remained stable
- You were seen by our social worker and psychiatrist who felt 
that outpatient treatment of your alcohol use disorder would be 
best

What should I do when I get home from the hospital?
- Continue to take your acid suppressing medication two times 
per day for the next 8 weeks
- You will need a follow-up endoscopy in 8 weeks to make sure 
that the inflammation in your esophagus has improved
- You MUST REFRAIN FROM ALL ALCOHOL as this can cause worsening 
of your esophageal inflammation
- If you have fevers, chills, notice blood in your vomit or 
stool, or generally feel unwell, please call your doctor or go 
to the emergency room

Sincerely,
Your ___ Treatment Team

History of Present Illness:
The pt is a ___ year-old R-handed woman with a past medical
history of a VP shunt placed on ___ who presents from 
___ after a fall two weeks ago and another this
evening with a CT scan showing a left-sided SDH.  

The history is obtained partly with help from her husband as she
is having some trouble with language currently.  She fell on ___ while in ___, by tripping backwards and hitting
the back of her head.  She then was brought to the ED at ___ in ___.  There, per report she had an
emergent left craniotomy for a left SDH (though the exact size 
of
it is not documented in the ___ notes) and then spent time in 
the
ICU.  She had some issues with word-finding, and headaches per
her husband and had to ""relearn how to do everything - talk, 
walk
etc"".  She had some right-sided deltoid weakness, that was
attributed (per the husband) to pain as that shoulder was hurt
during the fall.  She had memory/cognitive issues notes also. 
Her
VPS was changed to 2.5 in the setting of needing the emergent
craniotomy and then back to 1.5 at time of discharge.  She was
then sent to a SNF for one week and then to a rehabilitation
facility in ___ for 7 weeks.  

They transferred her to ___ in ___ next and
she has been there since ___.  However, two weeks ago (___), she tripped forwards and fell.  She was sent to the ED at
___ where they did a head CT and saw no new
hemorrhages. She was observed in the ED by neurosurgery for 
three
days, and then they sent her back to rehab.

She then fell today, likely backwards (where abrasion is), but
she doesn't recall the details.  She doesn't think this is
because of loss of consciousness or post-traumatic amnesia
though.  She was brought to ___ where a CT head showed an
acute/subacute SDH in the left lateral middle cranial fossa new
since the ___ CT.  It was read as stable mass effect from
the old CT with slightly more effacement of the temporal sulci,
but no evidence of midline shift.

There were no ICU beds available at ___, and they felt the
patient would likely need Q1H neuro checks, so sent her to ___
for further evaluation. 

In the ED she and her husband reported that her headaches and
language is worse today in comparison to previously.  Her 
husband
thinks that she would have some word-finding issues previously
but her language is now more hesitant and ""confused"".  

On neuro ROS, the pt reports headaches, right shoulder pain and
weakness and language issues, but denies loss of vision, blurred
vision, diplopia, dysarthria, dysphagia, lightheadedness,
vertigo, tinnitus or hearing difficulty. Denies difficulties
comprehending speech.  No new bowel or bladder incontinence or
retention. Denies newdifficulty with gait.
 
On general review of systems, the pt denies recent fever or
chills.  No night sweats or recent weight loss or gain. Denies
cough, shortness of breath.  Denies chest pain or tightness,
palpitations.  Denies nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation 
or
abdominal pain.  No recent change in bowel or bladder habits.  
No
dysuria.  Denies arthralgias or myalgias. Denies rash.

C. difficile DNA amplification assay (___): Negative for 
toxigenic C. difficile by the Illumigene DNA amplification 
assay. 

IMAGING
================
CT Head w/o contrast (___):
FINDINGS:  
Postsurgical changes related to prior right frontotemporal 
craniotomy are again noted. There is a heterogeneous subdural 
extra-axial collection with both hypodense and hypo to isodense 
fluid compatible with acute on chronic subdural hematoma. This 
measures 14 mm in width from the calvarium.  This is minimally 
increased from prior exam when it measured 12 mm.  There is 
subjacent sulcal effacement, 
and there is no she significant shift of midline structures.  
There is a right frontal ventriculostomy catheter which 
terminates in the frontal horn of the left lateral ventricle, 
and the ventricles are stable in size and configuration.  
Periventricular white matter hypodensities are nonspecific but 
likely sequela of chronic small vessel ischemic changes.  There 
is no new intracranial hemorrhage or vascular territorial 
infarction. There is mucosal thickening of the bilateral ethmoid 
air cells.  There is partial opacification of the right mastoid 
air cells.  The visualized orbits are unremarkable. 
IMPRESSION: 
1. Mild increase size of the left lateral convexity acute on 
chronic subdural hematoma.  No shift of midline structures. 
2. Right frontal ventriculostomy catheter terminates in the 
frontal horn of the left lateral ventricle. 
3. Stable ventricle size and configuration. 

CT spine w/o contrast (___): 
FINDINGS:  
Alignment is normal. No fractures are identified.  There is no 
prevertebral soft tissue swelling.  Patient is status post 
vertebroplasty of T12 and L1 with unchanged configuration 
compared with prior studies.  Posterior osteophytosis at this 
level causes at least moderate to severe spinal canal and neural 
foraminal stenosis (2:105, 106, 110). Partially imaged portions 
of the ventriculoperitoneal shunt appear intact. There is 
moderate atherosclerotic disease, including moderate coronary 
arterial calcifications.  Limited images of the chest and 
abdomen are 
otherwise unremarkable. 
IMPRESSION:   
Multilevel degenerative changes with evidence of prior 
vertebroplasty with no signs of acute fracture or change in 
alignment. 

Chest PA & LAT (___):
FINDINGS:  
AP upright and lateral views of the chest provided. The tubing 
again noted traversing the right hemi thorax consistent with VP 
shunt.  Lungs are clear.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette appears 
normal.  No acute osseous injury.  Vertebroplasty changes are 
noted at the thoracolumbar junction and in the mid lumbar spine. 

IMPRESSION:  
No acute findings. 

CT Head w/o contrast (___):
FINDINGS:  
Acute on chronic left subdural hematoma measuring approximately 
1.3 cm in greatest thickness is similar in size to prior 
examination.  Mass effect on the adjacent sulci is unchanged.  
There is no significant midline shift.  A right trans frontal 
ventriculostomy catheter with tip abutting the septum pellucidum 
near the foramen ___ is similar in appearance to prior 
examination.  There remains ventriculomegaly, similar in 
configuration from prior exam.  No new hemorrhage is identified. 
 There is no acute large territorial infarct.  Periventricular 
and subcortical white matter hypodensities are nonspecific, but 
compatible with chronic microangiopathy in a patient of this 
age.  A large left parietal scalp 9 mm thick hematoma is similar 
in appearance to prior exam.  Allowing for left pterional and 
parietal craniotomy, no acute osseous abnormalities.  The 
visualized paranasal sinuses are clear.  The orbits are 
unremarkable.   
IMPRESSION: 
1. No interval change in left lateral convexity acute on chronic 
subdural hematoma measuring up to 1.3 cm in greatest dimension.  
No significant midline shift. 

CT spine w/o contrast (___):  
FINDINGS:  
1. No evidence of acute fracture or malalignment of the thoracic 
spine. 
2. Status post T12 and L1 vertebroplasty with posterior 
osteophytosis/bone fragment  causing at least moderate to severe 
neural foraminal and spinal canal stenosis, unchanged. 

CT Head w/o contrast (___):
IMPRESSION:
1. Since the prior CT the left-sided subdural collection has 
evolved and slightly decreased in size. 
2. Ventricular size has decreased with consequent small right 
frontal subdural effusion. 

MR HEAD W/O CONTRAST (___):
IMPRESSION:
1. Unchanged left lateral convexity subdural hematoma measuring 
up to 9 mm in maximal thickness with localized mass effect, 
without significant midline shift. 
2. Small amount of left posterior parietal subarachnoid 
hemorrhage. 
3. Unchanged position of a right frontal approach VP shunt 
catheter with stable ventriculomegaly since ___. 
4. Confluent areas of white matter signal changes likely . 
5. Otherwise no definite new hemorrhage or acute infarct given 
limitations of susceptibility artifact from VP shunt reservoir.

NEUROPHYSIOLOGIC STUDIES
================
Routine EEG (___): 
FINDINGS:  
Background: The background rhythm over the right hemisphere is 
posterior 9.0 Hz alpha activity while over the left hemisphere 
the background is slower at the 7.5 - 8.0 Hz theta-alpha range. 
There is a breech rhythm over the left hemisphere with 
continuous slow ___ Hz delta activity in the keft posterior 
centralquadrant superimposed on the background. 
Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation was not performed. 
Intermittent Photic Stimulation: IPS did not produce a driving 
response 
Sleep: The patient was drowsy but did not progress beyond that 
stage. 
Cardiac Monitor: Heart rhythm was sinus throughout. 
Impression: This is an abnormal routine EEG. It shows a breech 
effect over the left hemisphere along with focal slowing in the 
left posterior central quadrant as well as left hemisphere 
slowing of the background activity. This is most compatible with 
a large left hemisphere structural abnormality and shows the 
post-surgical effect on the amplitude of left hemisphere 
activity. 
No epileptiform abnormalities were seen.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ is a ___ lady (R-handed) woman with normal 
pressure hydrocephalus characterized by gait difficulty, s/p VP 
shunt placed on ___, recent subdural hematoma (___) 
with residual word finding difficulty, RA s/p b/l TKR, HTN, HLD, 
GERD, hypothyroidism, and anxiety, who presented from ___ 
___ after a fall with headstrike on ___ w/o acute 
CT abnormalities, and another fall on ___, with CT notable 
for left lateral convexity acute on chronic SDH. 

#Subdural hematoma: Patient, who has NPH (primary gait 
abnormalities) w/VP shunt (placed ___, was admitted to ___ 
s/p fall with headstrike iso attempting to walk w/o walker on 
___, with OSH CT on ___ demonstrating acute on chronic SDH in 
left lateral convexity (L temporal area) measuring up to 1.3 cm, 
w/o midline shift or mass effect. Of note, pt had a recent SDH 
resulting from a similar fall while pt was on vacation in 
___ on ___, for which she received a craniotomy, and 
since when she has had residual word finding difficulty. Pt was 
admitted to neurosurgery at which point VP shunt was adjusted to 
2.5. She was also started on keppra 500 mg BID for seizure 
prophylaxis. Patient had no FNDs on neurologic exam and in the 
absence of mass effect/shift, there was no need for 
neurosurgical intervention. Repeat CT scans on ___ and ___ 
demonstrated that acute on chronic SDH was unchanged and 
remained w/o midline shift. On ___, patient and family felt that 
her word finding difficulty had worsened and that she was 
""severely confused."" Patient was transferred to medicine for 
management of these issues.  

On the medicine floor, patient was initially A&Ox1 (only to her 
first name) with poor attention on exam, difficulty with 
calculation, days of the week backwards, naming, repeating, 
following complex left-right commands, and had persistent word 
finding difficulties, which frustrated her. She was treated with 
nonpharmacologic delirium treatment including frequent 
re-orientation, light/day orientation, minimization of 
repetitive stimuli (sounds, lights), maximization of cognitive 
stimuli (conversation w/family and friends), and placement near 
nursing station. In addition, patient's alprazolam and melatonin 
were discontinued in order to minimize sedative medications. 
Neurology was consulted and they recommended repeat imaging and 
EEG. NCHCT on ___ and MRI on ___ show reduction in size of SDH, 
and no e/o new infarct or hemorrhage. VP shunt setting 
placement/setting were checked by neurosurgery following MRI 
(set at 2.5). EEG on ___ was notable for left sided slowing 
likely ___ left sided cerebral dysfunction iso patient's acute 
on chronic SDH. Given no e/o seizure on EEG, patient should stop 
keppra 500 mg BID after finishing 14-day course (___).

At the time of discharge, patient's orientation had improved to 
A&Ox2 (thinks it is ___, she was able to calculate that 7 
quarters is $1.75, had improvement in naming (""pen, stethoscope, 
and cup""), and was able to follow complex left-right commands, 
although her word finding difficulties persisted.  Patient's 
residual word finding difficulty and impaired mental status will 
likely improve with continued resolution of the subdural 
hematoma and with a combination of physical therapy, occupation 
therapy, and speech therapy.

#Hyponatremia: Pt admitted with Na 132, which decreased to 129 
on ___, with repeat Na 132 following administration of salt tabs 
and IVF on ___. Urine lytes on ___: UreaN:876, Creat:97, Na:137, 
Osmolal:717, FeNa 0.5%. SOsm 285. Given improvement in Na with 
IVF and FeNa<1%, initially thought that hyponatremia was likely 
___ to hypovolemia, although considered an additional component 
of SIADH given high UNa and high UOsm, and patient's significant 
neurologic disease. Na 132 on ___ and 134 on ___ s/p 1L IVF on 
___. Na decreased again to 132 on ___ and ___ with continued 
mIFV, with repeat urine lytes on ___: Uosm: 482, UCreat:107, 
UNa:84 on ___, FeNa 0.3%, more c/w SIADH. Likely that patient 
has SIADH, and was having superimposed hypovolemic hyponatremia 
on top of that. Na 131 on ___. Instituted 2L PO fluid 
restriction, held mIVF, with Na 131 at time of discharge. 

#UTI: Patient had UA on initial workup in ED on ___ notable for 
WBC, RBC, bacteria, and large leukocyte esterase. She denied any 
dysuria, urinary frequency, and did not have a Foley. Urine cx 
obtained, and she was started on empiric ciprofloxacin PO 500 mg 
q12hrUrine cx ___ negative. Urine cx resulted negative on ___, 
and empiric ciprofloxacin was discontinued.  

#HTN: Patient's BPs ranged from ___ throughout 
hospitalization. Patient continued on home amlodipine and 
atenolol. 

#HLD: Patient was continued on home pravastatin.

#RA: Patient is s/p bilateral TKR. She has some slight ulnar 
deviation and Swan neck deformities on exam. Says her joints 
hurt intermittently, but that this is her b/l right now. Patient 
was continued on home prednisone 4 mg QD and home plaquenil. 
Patient's home leflunomide was held while receiving empiric 
antibiotics for c/f UTI and was started at time of discharge, 
per patient's outpatient rheumatologist, Dr. ___, 
___.

#Hypothyroidism: Patient was continued on her home 
levothyroxine.

#GERD: Patient was continued on her home pantoprazole.

#Lumbar spinal stenosis/back pain: Patient was continued on her 
home gabapentin and home lidocaine patch.

#Anxiety/Insomnia: Patient was continued on her home sertraline 
and home trazodone.
Her home alprazolam and melatonin were discontinued iso waxing 
and waning orientation and not restarted for discharge.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___,

You were admitted to the Acute Care Surgery service on ___ 
after a fall from standing. You were found to have a small left 
sided head bleed that has been stable on CT scan. You were seen 
and evaluated by the neurosurgery team who determined no 
surgical intervention was needed, although you continued to have 
word finding difficulty which was worse than your baseline and 
you were also intermittently confused. You were transferred to 
the medicine team for management of these issues that are likely 
related to the brain bleed. While on the medicine team, your 
confusion and word finding difficulty improved and repeat CT and 
MRI imaging showed that your head bleed was reducing in size. 
You will likely improve as your bleed continues to resolve, and 
you will likely benefit from physical therapy, occupational 
therapy, and speech therapy. 

Following discharge, please make sure that you:
#Please call your PCP, ___ (___), to set 
up an appointment to be seen within one week of discharge. 
#Please also call Neurosurgery at ___ to set up a follow-up 
appointment with Dr. ___ (___) to be seen 
within one week of discharge. 
#Please also call your rheumatologist, Dr. ___, 
(___), to schedule an appointment to be seen within two 
weeks of your discharge.    

 
Followup Instructions:
___
","Certainly! Here are the reasons for the ICD-10 codes based on the medical record:

**S065X0A: Traumatic subdural hemorrhage without loss of consciousness, initial encounter**
- **Reason**: The patient presented with a left lateral convexity acute on chronic subdural hematoma (SDH) after multiple falls. The medical record specifically mentions that she does not think the falls were due to loss of consciousness or post-traumatic amnesia.

**F05: Delirium due to known physiological condition**
- **Reason**: The patient exhibited confusion, word-finding difficulty, and impaired mental status, which were attributed to the subdural hematoma. These symptoms improved with nonpharmacologic delirium treatment and management.

**E222: Syndrome of inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone**
- **Reason**: The patient had hyponatremia, which was initially thought to be due to hypovolemia but later determined to be likely secondary to SIADH, given the high urine sodium and osmolality.

**M069: Rheumatoid arthritis, unspecified**
- **Reason**: The patient has a history of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and has undergone bilateral total knee replacements (TKRs).

History of Present Illness:
___ female with PMH of bilateral parietal polymicrogyria
pachygyria (dx MRI ___, autism with cog impairment, and recent
diagnosis of progressive eustachian tube dysfunction, and mild 
CP
(grand mal seizure at ___ presenting with acute SI and active
plan. Mother providing most of history per patient request. She
states that she has been declining mentally with thoughts of
ending her life due to feeling hollow. Her plan is to wake up
early and overdose on her medications and slit her wrists. Has
not attempted before. No HI/AH/VH. Her mother states that she 
has
been in a partial hospitalization program (Triangle) and goes
home on the weekend with her, however, patient has been
declining. Her most acute stressor is learning that the
eustachian tube dysfunction is worsening with attic retraction
pockets bilaterally. Patient has reportedly been cutting her
wrists and verbally abusing her mother, with history of throwing
furniture during hospitalizations. 

Also complaining of white, curdled vaginal discharge and
requesting yeast infection med. Has never had pelvic exam 
before.
No dysuria, hematuria, pruritus, N/V/CD.

On ___. Mother at bedside is LICSW and HCP.

- Initial vital signs: T 99.8 HR 89 BP114/75 RR 18 100% RA 
- Exam notable for: Mild irritation noted to wrist.
- Labs were notable for: Contaminated UA, neg UCG, nl CBC+BMP
- Studies performed include: EKG w NSR, QTc 449
- Patient was given: fluconazole 150mg x1, macrobid ___ x1,
many doses of quetiapine, prazosin, sertraline, hydroxyzine, mag
ox as patient in ED from ___

- Consults: PSYCH 
Initial (___)
1. Continue ___. ___ not leave AMA. Continue CO. 
2. Will initiate inpatient bed search. 
3. Continue patient's home medications:
---- Seroquel 50 mg QID
---- Atarax 25 mg TID 
---- Zoloft 150 mg QHS
4. Unlikely to require chemical restraint, would recommend 
verbal
redirection and behavioral intervention. If patient does not
respond, would recommend offering Seroquel 50 mg PRN. Recommend
avoiding IM antipsychotic medication if at all possible.

Upon arrival to the floor, patient's mother provides majority of
hx as patient states she is very anxious from the transfer from
ED, which patient and family were not told about ahead of time
until stretcher arrived to bring her upstairs. Given her autism,
she appreciates early warning for changes such as these. She 
also
is anxious because of 1:1 sitter, and wondering when can be
discontinued as denies any SI/SIB for several days. Per her
mother, the action of 1:1 sitter staring directly at her
exacerbates anxiety in patients on autism spectrum. No other
concerns.

History of Present Illness:
Mr. ___ is a ___ man with TBI and epilepsy who
presents as a transfer from ___ for status epilepticus
(total time possibly 60 minutes). He had a witnessed 30min long
seizure where he stiffened and stared off into space. Per 
mother,
eyes rolled back into his head and his breathing was terrible.
Did bite his lip, did not have any urinary incontinence. EMS was
called, found him to have ""clonic type rigidity, trismus, rapid
eye fluttering and nonsensical moaning."" Eyes were open but pt
unresponsive to verbal/painful stimuli, had a lip skin tear and
moderate amount of frothy sputum. Vitals at that time BP 
180/110,
RR22, O2 sat 96%. Family believes that seizure activity was
brought on by EtOH use today.

He received 5mg IV versed but continued to remain stiff and
unresponsive. Contacted ___ and got another 2mg IV
versed. There is some discrepancy between OSH nursing/attending
notes and EMS notes- per nursing notes, pt got total of 12mg
valium. He was still unresponsive to painful stimuli. Had 
several
additional seizure-like episodes described as rigid hypertonia
and left gaze deviation. Got additional doses of Ativan (total
4mg) and fosphenytoin. Intubated via RSI with etomidate and
succinylcholine and placed on ventilator, sedated with propofol.
Had fever ___, LP bland. Empirically covered with ceftriaxone. 

Had seizures ___ years ago in setting of not drinking alcohol per
brother, likely withdrawal. He drinks about 1 pint per day,
perhaps more. Unknown when his last drink was. He has not had a
seizure in the last ___ years. He is not on any antiseizure
medications. 

TBI from getting hit by a train. Required a L craniotomy and LLE
amputation. 

Per mother and brother, he seemed fine yesterday am, no fever, 
no
cough, no urinary complaints.

IMAGING:
RUQ u/s: normal

Extended routine EEG: markedly abnormal EEG due to the low 
voltage slow background throughout and the additional theta and 
delta slowing more broadly over the left hemisphere. The 
widespread low voltage slowing suggests a widespread 
encephalopathy. Medications, metabolic disturbances, and 
infection are among the most common causes. Often the low 
voltage fast pattern suggests medication effect. His persistent 
slowing over the left hemisphere raises the possibility of a 
focal structural abnormality on that side. Nevertheless, there 
were no epileptiform features or electrographic seizures in the 
recording. 
--> FYI he was on Ativan/valium during this EEG
 
Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ is a ___ man with EtOH withdrawal seizures, L 
parietal TBI, and depression on TCA who was admitted ___ 
with at least 60 minutes convulsive status epilepticus requiring 
intubation. Unknown when his last drink was, but he does have a 
possible history of seizures in the setting of EtOH withdrawal. 
On exam, he did not follow commands or blink to threat but moves 
all extremities spontaneously. NCHCT/CTA head negative for acute 
processes. Urine was positive for TCA and acetone, negative 
acetaminophen levels, negative EtOH level, and fever to ___. 
CSF bland, got 2g ceftriaxone empirically. He was given ?12mg 
versed/valium (unclear which) and 4mg Ativan at ___ 
along with 1g fosphenytoin to stop seizures and was subsequently 
intubated for airway protection and transferred to ___ for 
further management. Here, he was found to have rhabdomyolysis 
and a transaminitis. Continuous EEG negative for non-convulsive 
status epilepticus and only showed generalized slowing 
suggestive of encephalopathy and no epileptiform discharges. He 
was started on thiamin and continued on dilantin. He was 
extubated ___ and transferred to the floor, where he 
appeared to be withdrawing from alcohol. Placed on CIWA protocol 
with Ativan and transitioned to scheduled valium ___ with 
prn valium per CIWA>10. 

1. Seizure: switched from phenytoin to keppra 1g BID given his 
transaminitis. cvEEG was negative for epileptiform discharges, 
and extended routine EEG that was obtained due to interval L 
gaze preference showed no epileptiform discharges. No longer has 
gaze preference. Seizure likely due to alcohol withdrawal. 

2. EtOH withdrawal, delirium tremens: started on thiamin in ICU 
prior to receiving any dextrose here at ___, also placed on 
folate and MVI. Initially treated with Ativan for CIWA>10, some 
concern for oversedation but pt remained very agitated 
throughout his course outside the ICU. Transitioned to scheduled 
Ativan 0.5mg q6h and then to valium 7.5mg q8h with prn valium 
2.5mg q8h for CIWA>10. Thiamin continued throughout his course. 
IV thiamin 250mg qd scheduled to stop ___, please start IV/po 
thiamin 100mg qd thereafter to be continued indefinitely.

3. Rhabdomyolysis: CK peaked at 70,000 and trended down with the 
administration of IVF. Creatinine remained stable at 0.7 
throughout his hospital course. On transfer, CK was ___.

4. Elevated liver enzymes: likely due to rhabdomyolysis as 
muscle also produces these enzymes. AST peaked at 1047 and ALT 
peaked at 436. Both are trending down at time of discharge. 
Acute hepatitis panel checked and was only positive for HCV 
antibodies, which was expected given his history of hep C s/p 12 
wks Harvoni. Hepatitis C viral load nondetectable.

5. Electrolyte abnormalities: pt was hypokalemic and repleted. 
His glucose was also in the ___ while in the ICU for which he 
received dextrose after IV thiamin administered. While on the 
floor, he did not tolerate a DHT (kept pulling out DHT, concern 
for aspiration PNA should tube feeds be continued in the setting 
of agitation) so was started on D5LR. Thiamin was also continued 
through this time. 

Transitional issues:
1. Continue IV fluids for rhabdo
2. Transition from 250mg IV thiamin to 100mg IV thiamin ___ to 
continue indefinitely (can switch to po once he is safe to 
swallow)
3. Taper off valium as pt tolerates it. He should not be 
discharged to home (either from hospital or rehab) on 
benzodiazepines as he was put on them only for withdrawal 
symptoms
4. Nutrition: pt did not tolerate DHT-kept pulling it out while 
tube feeds were running which puts him at risk for aspiration 
PNA. As he wakes up, he may be able to tolerate food
5. MRI head to check for acute/subacute issues/axonal injury 
(this is low on our differential, but should his mental status 
remain the same, he may warrant an MRI head prior to discharge)
6. Please set up appointment with neurologist close to where he 
lives (it is difficult for him and his family to come to ___ 
for follow-up), they will need to follow up on keppra and 
whether or not it should be continued in the setting of seizure 
likely from EtOH withdrawal

Most recent plan:
1. Seizure: resolved, EEG showed slowing, mental status not back 
at baseline
- continue Keppra 1g po BID
- f/u MRI head
- seizure precautions

2. EtOH withdrawal, ?delirium tremens
- continue thiamin 250mg po x5 days (stop ___ then 100mg po 
qd (start ___
- continue po folate
- CIWA protocol with valium
- valium 7.5mg IV q8h

3. Rhabdomyolysis
- trend CK q24h
- continue D5LR with 20meq KCl @125cc/hr
- goal UOP >100cc/hr

4. Elevated liver enzymes: EtOH history, hx hep C s/p Harvoni, 
got fosphenytoin/Dilantin, also has severe rhabdomyolysis which 
could cause AST to be elevated without proportional elevation in 
ALT 
- trend LFTs q24hr

5. Electrolyte abnormalities
- replete prn

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___,

You were admitted to ___ as a transfer from ___ for a 
seizure that lasted greater than 1 hour. You received 
medications to stop the seizures, but this required you to be 
intubated and extubated the day after. You were continued on an 
oral seizure medication called Keppra. 

You had quite a bit of muscle break down due to your seizures, 
so you were started on IV fluids to protect your kidneys from 
damage from the muscle breakdown. Your liver enzymes were high, 
but this was likely due to your muscle break down as well. 

The cause of your seizure was likely due to alcohol withdrawal. 
We treated you for alcohol withdrawal while you were in the 
hospital. Please do not drink any more alcohol, as this is 
detrimental to your health. 

It was a pleasure taking care of you in the hospital, and we 
wish you the best!

Sincerely,
Your ___ Team

Followup Instructions:
___
","R509: Fever, unspecified
- Reason: The patient presented with fevers, including an objective fever of 103 degrees, and continued to have intermittent fevers with sweats and rigors. The specific cause of the fever was not definitively identified, making it appropriate to code as an unspecified fever.

L7622: Postprocedural hemorrhage of skin and subcutaneous tissue following other procedure
- Reason: The patient had a known right abdominal wall hematoma, which was aspirated to rule out an infectious source of her fevers. This hematoma is a postprocedural complication following her previous open pylorus-preserving pancreaticoduodenectomy with cholecystectomy.

J45909: Unspecified asthma, uncomplicated
- Reason: The patient""s past medical history includes asthma, and there is no indication in the medical record that the asthma was complicated during this admission.

Z8507: Personal history of malignant neoplasm of pancreas
- Reason: The patient has a family history of pancreatic cancer, and her brother was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. While the patient herself does not have pancreatic cancer, this code reflects her personal risk factor due to family history.

Y836: Removal of other organ (partial) (total) as the cause of abnormal reaction of the patient, or of later complication, without mention of misadventure at the time of the procedure
- Reason: The patient previously underwent an open pylorus-preserving pancreaticoduodenectomy with cholecystectomy, which involved the removal of part of the pancreas and the gallbladder. This code indicates that the removal of these organs is a potential source of complications, such as the abdominal wall hematoma and fevers.

Y92239: Unspecified place in hospital as the place of occurrence of the external cause
- Reason: The patient was transferred to the hospital for evaluation and management of her fevers and abdominal pain. This code indicates that the events leading to her hospitalization occurred in an unspecified place within the hospital.

R1013: Epigastric pain
- Reason: The patient reported intermittent abdominal pain associated with the fevers. While the pain was noted to be in the lower left quadrant (LLQ) on examination, the chief complaint includes epigastric pain, which is a more specific location in the upper abdomen.","You are a coder who is proficient in ICD10.

IMAGING & STUDIES
============

___ Axillary Lymph Node Biopsy
SPECIMEN: LYMPH NODE
CLINICAL HISTORY: Chronic lymphocytic leukemia
CYTOGENETIC DIAGNOSIS: 45,XY,-9,add(17)(p11.2)[6]/ 
___
INTERPRETATION/COMMENT: Six of the metaphase left axillary lymph 
node cells examined had an abnormal karyotype with a missing 
chromosome 9 and a rearrangement of chromosome 17 that ___ has 
confirmed has resulted in deletion of the TP53 gene (see below). 
___ also demonstrated that the large majority of cells in this 
lymph node have the previously observed (___) deletion 
13q14. These findings are consistent with progression of the 
patient's known chronic lymphocytic leukemia to higher grade 
disease.

___ Pleural fluid cytology
PLEURAL FLUID, LEFT:
ATYPICAL.
Numerous lymphocytes and blood (see note).

___ Bilateral Lower Extremity Veins Ultrasound
IMPRESSION: 
No evidence of deep venous thrombosis in the right or left lower 
extremity
veins.  The peroneal veins were not well visualized bilaterally 
due to
subcutaneous edema.

___ Echocardiogram

Very suboptimal image quality. The left atrial volume index is 
normal. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. 
The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Due to suboptimal 
technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be 
fully excluded. Overall left ventricular systolic function is 
normal (LVEF = 70%). There is considerable beat-to-beat 
variability of the left ventricular ejection fraction due to an 
irregular rhythm/premature beats. Tissue Doppler imaging 
suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure 
(PCWP>18mmHg). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall 
motion are normal. The aortic root is mildly dilated at the 
sinus level. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally 
normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis or 
aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly 
thickened. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. The pulmonary 
artery systolic pressure could not be determined. There is no 
pericardial effusion. 

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of ___, 
cardiac rhythm is now atrial fibrillation; no obvious change in 
function but the technically suboptimal nature of both studies 
precludes definitive comparison. 

___ CTA Chest

IMPRESSION: 
1.  Suboptimal contrast timing decreases sensitivity to 
detection of filling
defects within the subsegmental pulmonary arterial branches.  No 
central
pulmonary embolus or right heart strain pattern.
2.  Moderate left and small right pleural effusions with 
associated
compressive atelectasis.
3.  Extensive lymphadenopathy, similar to most recent comparison 
examination,
compatible with patient's history of CLL.

___ Lower Extremity Duplex Ultrasound
IMPRESSION:  
Acute nonocclusive thrombus demonstrated throughout the right 
axillary vein, subclavian vein, and basilic vein with 
visualization of an intraluminal PICC line.

11q on ibrutinib who presented with rapid disease progression.

#CLL
#Pancytopenia
Rapidly progressive disease on ibrutinib with LN biopsy negative 
for Richter transformation to large cell lymphoma. He was 
initiated on venetoclax, day 1 = ___. This treatment was 
dose reduced initially by 50% for its interactions with 
diltiazem. He was started on 10 mg x 7 days, 20 mg x 3 days and 
then increased to 50 mg on ___. His course was complicated 
by pancytopenia, a known complication of venetoclax. Since he 
did not have the 50mg pills, he was treated with 100mg every 
other day. He was given filgrastim on ___ and ___ to support 
his ANC while on venetoclax. While on Venetoclax, he was 
monitored with frequent TLS/renal function labs, without 
evidence of lysis or kidney injury. He was given sevelamer 800 
mg TID to be taken with meals as well as allopurinol ___ mg 
daily, which were both continued on discharge. He was initially 
started on 100 mg prednisone daily (received x 5 days), which 
was tapered over the course of a week (last dose ___. In 
the setting of high dose prednisone and IVF for initiation of 
venetoclax, he developed marked peripheral volume overload and 
was started on 40 mg PO Lasix BID. Due to soft BPs, this Lasix 
was discontinued. If he continues to have peripheral edema as an 
outpatient, can consider restarting Lasix.

# Malignant Pleural Effusion
Prior to presentation, he was admitted to ___ 
___ for large left sided pleural effusion. He underwent 
removal of 1200 cc via thoracentesis, with cytology consistent 
with CLL. Upon discharge, he had a CT chest which remonstrated a 
moderate pleural effusion. During this admission, he had a 
repeat thoracentesis on ___, with removal of 1 L of sanguinous 
fluid. Pleural fluid studies exudative and consistent with CLL. 
He was initially continued on IV ceftriaxone, which was later 
discontinued as pleural studies from both OSH and ___ were 
without evidence of infection. His pleural effusion was 
monitored by symptom, O2 requirement and progression on CXR 
throughout the admission. He was evaluated on multiple 
subsequent occasions by interventional pulmonology, but did not 
require additional thoracentesis. He will follow up with IP at 
___ as an outpatient for further management on ___.

#New onset atrial fibrillation
#Sinus tachycardia
New onset atrial fibrillation with RVR into 170-180s during this 
admission. He was stabilized with a regimen of PO diltiazem and 
metoprolol, with IV diltiazem as needed during episodes of RVR. 
Given his a-fib was refractory to initial medication management, 
cardiology was consulted. He had an ECHO performed on ___ 
without evidence of thrombus, CHF or valvular abnormalities. 
A-fib felt to most likely be multifactorial in the setting of 
pleural effusion, malignancy, ibrutinib therapy. Given his 
relatively low risk of both stroke and bleeding, we did not 
initiate systemic anticoagulation in setting of ongoing marrow 
suppressive therapy and worsening thrombocytopenia. He was 
monitored on telemetry throughout the admission. He required 
careful titration of medications in setting of peripheral volume 
overload, IVF with venetoclax chemotherapy, hypoxia and soft 
BPs. After approximately 2 weeks in atrial fibrillation, he 
spontaneously converted into sinus rhythm, however continued to 
experience sinus tachycardia. CTA was obtained, which was 
without evidence of PE. Due to the interaction of diltiazem and 
venetoclax, as well as hypotension with high doses of diltiazem, 
we favored uptitration of metoprolol. He was ultimately well 
controlled on Metoprolol succinate 100mg. He will follow up with 
Dr. ___ at ___ Card___.

#Peripheral edema
#Marked lymphedema to BLE
#RLE skin tear
Peripheral edema present on admission, which worsened in the 
setting of high dose steroids and IVF during chemotherapy. 
Additionally, presence of a small skin tear on RLE, which 
appeared to be an erosion, which led to weeping fluid in the 
setting of his marked edema. He was evaluated by wound nurse who 
recommended daily dressing changes and use of ace bandages. He 
was initiated on treatment with furosemide 40 mg PO BID. This 
was discontinued prior to discharge in setting of soft BPs. It 
can be reconsidered in the outpatient setting if he continues to 
have persistent peripheral edema. He has follow up scheduled in 
the wound clinic on ___. He should continue daily 
dressing changes to BLE lymphedema wounds and elevate his legs 
when sitting. We have arranged ___ services to visit once weekly 
to reevaluate.

#PICC line erythema
Erythema surrounding PICC line site on his right inner arm. 
Completed cephalexin 500 mg QID x 5 days.

#Right upper extremity DVT
PICC line associated acute non-occlusive thrombus extending from 
right basilica vein to right axillary vein. Treated with 
lovenox.

#Hypogammaglobulinemia
SPEP with evidence of hypogammaglobulinemia. For prevention of 
infection, given course of IVIG x 3 doses while inpatient 
(___).

#Chronically elevated serum bicarbonate
Patient with apparent chronically elevated bicarbonate level. 
VBG with CO2 ___. CO2 retention is most likely secondary to 
hypoventilation in the setting of ankylosing spondylitis and 
SAPHO syndrome.

# Ankylosing Spondylitis
# SAPHO
Home percocet was held and he was given oxycodone PRN while 
inpatient.

# HTN
Discontinued home atenolol as started metoprolol per above.

Brief Hospital Course:
Patient was admitted to neurosurgery on ___ s/p fall off 
bicycle while intoxicated with TBI, bifrontal, bitemporal IPH 
and SDH along falx. He was transferred to the Neuro ICU for 
atrial fibrillation/tachycardia. Following improvement in the 
NICU, she was transferred to the step down unit, and eventually 
the floor where his neurologic exam remained stable. 

#TBI
Patient was admitted to neurosurgery to the ICU. He was started 
on Keppra and hypertonic saline for Na control. Repeat NCHCT was 
obtained 6 hours from prior which remained stable. The patient 
remained in the TSICU intubated and sedated. He was extubated on 
___. Repeat CTs on ___ and ___ were stable. Patient was 
reintubated on ___ for respiratory issues. Patient self 
extubated from a forceful cough and maintained his respiratory 
status on shovel mask. His pupils were dilated by ophthalmology 
on ___. He was reintubated on ___ and later extubated on 
___. MRI of the brain on ___ showed no evidence of stroke. 
He was restrated on gabapentin and Seroquel was decreased. His 
salt tabs were eventually weaned to off for normal sodium 
levels. Guardianship paperwork was started on ___, as the 
patient's ex-wife no longer wished to fulfill that role, however 
on ___, she agreed to continue being his HCP. On ___, he was 
unable to move his left upper extremity, and would only 
minimally withdraw to noxious stimuli. Head CT revealed a large 
chronic right sided subdural hematoma. The patient was taken to 
the OR urgently for right burr hole for evacuation. The OR was 
uncomplicated. Please see OMR for further intraoperative 
details. Postoperative imaging showed improvement and remained 
stable. The patient remained intubated postoperatively and was 
taken for a right MMA embolization the next day, on ___. This 
procedure was also uncomplicated. Please see OMR for further 
intraoperative details. The patient was extubated on ___. He 
remained neurologically stable and was transferred to the ___ 
on ___. The patient's neurological status improved while in 
___, and he was noted to be more alert and conversant. The 
patient's neurological status continued to improve in the NIMU 
as sedating medications were weaned off. The patient was 
transferred to the floor for further care awaiting disposition. 
On the floor, he had intermittent episodes of agitation and 
repeatedly tried to get out of bed. On ___, he fell onto the 
ground while trying to get out of bed, however, HCT was stable 
following the incident. He was re-evaluated by psychiatry who 
recommended increasing Depakote for agitation. On Depakote, LFTs 
became elevated. Depakote stopped on ___ per hepatology 
recommendations. Due to continued pain, gabapentin was titrated 
up as tolerated with a goal of 
returning the patient to his home dose of gabapentin. He was 
found to be picking at his incision, and this was closely 
monitored. Incision remained dry with granulation tissue. The 
patient was occasionally felt to be depressed, and when 
psychiatry was consulted they recommended outpatient follow up 
once patient is in rehab. Follow up will also be arranged with 
Dr. ___ in neurosurgery in approximately 4 weeks. He will 
return and a repeat HCT will be performed to assess for 
resolution of the SDH. At the time of discharge, he was 
ambulating with assistance using the walker, pain was adequately 
controlled on an oral regimen and his neurologic exam remained 
stable. 

#Decreased Left Lower Extremity Movement
The patient had an MRI of the total spine in the setting of 
continued decreased movement of his left lower extremity, which 
was notable for syringohydromyelia and old blood products within 
the thoracic spine. Per patient's family, the patient was also 
ambulating previously with a cane. This is likely traumatic 
syringomyelia vs chronic arachnoiditis leading to syringomyelia. 
On ___, the patient was not moving his left lower extremity as 
well as the prior day and a CT head was ordered which revealed 
stable HCT. The change in mental status was likely due to opioid 
medications for PEG placement. Patient's LLE improved over the 
course of his hospital stay. However, the patient will need 
continued intensive physical therapy to increase mobility and 
strength, and to increase function in the left lower extremity. 
He is at significant risk for falls and should be maintained on 
fall precautions, with additional fall precautions such as a low 
bed at nighttime. 

#Fevers 
On ___ the patient spiked fever and was started on vanc/zosyn. 
He was pan cultured. Due to persistent tachycardia, blood 
cultures were obtained on ___ that showed staphylococcus, 
however this was likely a contaminate as blood cultures x3 were 
negative thereafter.  The patient was treated for an aspiration 
pneumonia with ceftriaxone. A CXR obtained on ___, 
demonstrated no focal consolidation or concern for pneumonia. 
Ceftriaxone was discontinued ___. The patient remained afebrile 
for the remainder of his hospitalization.

#Transaminitis
On ___, patient was noted to have elevated LFT's.  Hepatology 
was consulted who recommended discontinuing Depakote in the 
setting of hepatitis C and elevated LFT's. Repeat LFT's were 
trended, hepatitis panel was sent. Liver U/S was performed which 
revealed mild splenomegaly and normal morphology of liver 
without lesions noted. LFTs were checked daily while in hospital 
and were down trending since cessation of Depakote, however on 
monitoring on ___ they increased and were closely monitored 
for the remainder of his hospitalization. LFTs were also checked 
on ___ and showed slightly elevated AST and ALT. LFTs should 
be continued to be followed with his PCP to assess for rapid 
elevation. Caution should be used when using Depakote for mood 
stabilization as this previously resulted in significant LFT 
elevation.  

#ETOH withdrawal/agitation
The patient developed ETOH withdrawal and agitation while in the 
TSICU. He was started on Seroquel and Precedex drip. He was 
given small phenobarbital bolus x1, and was later started on a 
phenobarbital taper. The patient then continued on Seroquel and 
Clonidine with PRN Haldol IV. Psych was consulted on ___ for 
further recommendations. He was started on Depakote QHS on 
___, this dose was titrated per psychology recommendations 
according to patients response and agitation. Patient was 
discharged on Depakote 250mg Q12hrs, 25mg Seroquel PRN HS. On 
___, clonidine was titrated down to 0.1mg q8hrs per cardiology 
recs. On ___, the clonidine was further titrated down. 
Agitation improved over the course of his hospitalization. He is 
no longer requiring Seroquel, deptakote, or restraints. 

#Orbital roof fracture
Orbital roof fracture was noted on CT, ophthalmology and plastic 
surgery were consulted. Lateral canthotomy was lengthened. No 
globe injury was identified.  No urgent surgical intervention 
was recommended.  His pupils were dilated by ophthalmology on 
___ after extubation. Optho re-evaluated the patient on ___ 
to measure ocular pressures and findings were likely normal. 
Ophthalmology unable to fully assess visual acuity due to 
patient's metal status. They recommend follow up outpatient for 
a routine exam and patient as discharged with information to 
make this appointment. (See discharge info for phone number of 
clinic). 

#Left parietal bone fracture
ENT was consulted for recommendations on management of fracture. 
No acute intervention was recommended. He completed a course of 
Neomycin-Polymyxin-HC otic drops. There was no facial paralysis 
noted upon extubation. Patient needs follow-up with ENT for his 
Ossicular chain discontinuity. 

#New onset Afib
The patient developed new onset Atrial Fibrillation while in the 
TSICU. He was not a candidate for anticoagulation in the setting 
of recent TBI with contusions. On ___, due to persistent 
hypertension and tachycardia not controlled by IV
Metoprolol, and he was transferred to the NICU where he briefly 
required a Nicardipine, Diltiazem drip and Precedex. He later 
improved and was able to tolerate PO medications. On ___, the 
patient's HR dipped down into the 30's, but he remained 
asymptomatic. His PO Diltiazem was held. Overnight on the ___, 
he went back into atrial fibrillation and his PO Diltiazem was 
resumed at 30mg Q6hrs. Patient also on PO metoprolol tartrate, 
which was increased on ___ to 50mg q6hrs due to persistent 
afib with RVR. Based on cardiolgy recommendations, Metoprolol 
was further increased to 75 mg q6 hr. Patient to discuss 
anticoagulation options for Afib at outpatient follow up. On 
___, patient's HR's transiently down to ___ while sleeping, 
while awake HR 40-50s. Metoprolol decreased to 37.5mg q6h.

Based on cardiology recommendations, the patient was then 
transitioned to Digoxin 0.25, long acting digoxin 240 mg, and 
Metoprolol succinate 200 mg. Due to episodes of bradycardia the 
patient was then transitioned back to q6 dosing of metoprolol 
and diltiazem to prevent prolonged bradycardic episodes. Patient 
should follow up with a PCP to adjust these medications as 
needed. Patient will also need cardiology follow-up given 
persistent afib, and to titrate medications as needed. The 
patient should not be started on systemic anti-coagulation until 
cleared by neurosurgery. 

#Nutrition
The patient was evaluated by SLP, who recommended that he be 
NPO. An NG tube was placed, which the patient pulled out. 
Attempts were made to replace it x7, without success. GI was 
consulted and attempted to replace it, but was unsuccessful. It 
will be replaced under visualization on ___. Formal speech 
trials were attempted again however patient did not do well 
given oral secretions and altered mentation. After multiple 
failed attempts to replace NGT, the patient was brought to 
endoscopy suite with GI to place NJ tube. He was started on tube 
feedings with recommendations for nutrition. On the morning of 
___, the patient became acutely agitated and self-discontinued 
NJ tube despite restraints. However, he was then able to eat his 
meals with 1:1 RN supervision. SLP re-evaluated the patient on 
___, and continued to recommend NPO with trials under RN 
supervision. Due to acute decompensation from worsening ___ 
patient was again unable to safely intake PO. An NG tube was 
placed successfully post-operatively. Speech evaluated patient 
again post-operatively on ___ and recommended patient be NPO 
and PEG placement for continued nutritional support. ACS was 
consulted for PEG placement. Nutrition consult recommended 
temporary PPN until PEG placed. PEG was placed on ___ without 
issues. When CXR was obtained and showed increased air under the 
right hemi diaphragm, ACS evaluated the patient and felt that 
findings were not concerning. On ___ the patient was more 
awake, and SLP cleared for sips of water. Over the subsequent 
few days, this swallowing improved, and he was cleared for a 
ground diet. Tubefeeds were changed to being cycled overnight. 
Cleared for regular diet and thin liquids with supervision on 
___. Tolerating diet with 1:1 supervision, PEG remains in 
place but not currently receiving tube feedings. Patient's PEG 
site looked red and the bumper was not visible on ___. ACS was 
paged who pulled back the bumper and removed the T bumper and 
replaced it with a star bumper on ___. ACS did not 
recommend prophylactic abx at this time as WBC low and no signs 
of infection. Patient will continue with PEG placement for at 
least ___ weeks post placement, then may be removed. Nursing

History of Present Illness:
___ w/ polysubstance abuse (IV heroin, cocaine), tobacco use,
HCV, HTN, who p/w weakness, dyspnea, and vomiting. 

The patient is a vague historian. He lives alone in a room above
the ___. He says he eats badly and sometimes go a
long time between meals, largely owing to poor food access. He
says he has money for food, but cannot be bothered to go out in
the setting of escalating fatigue/weakness/unintentional weight
loss. Just stays home and does drugs instead. 

Regarding his drug use, he is a longstanding cocaine user and
continues to use this actively. He has recently stopped taking
Suboxone (unclear why) and has instead ""reintroduced heroin to 
my
regimen."" He has only injected a couple times since making the
decision to relapse. Although he appears to be possibly
intoxicated with some deliriant at the time of my interview, he
denies any intentional use of any other drugs. 

He had several episodes of vomiting, and also subjective
shortness of breath in the early morning hours of ___. He
walked to the store but then felt too fatigued and ill to walk
back. He requested a ride home from a nearby EMS crew (who had
showed up in his immediate area to assess a different patient).
EMS did not feel that he was in any distress, noted that his
vitals were stable (HR 72, BP 118/82, not hypoxic), but they
brought him to the ED for evaluation given his reported 
symptoms.

In the ED, vitals remained stable, but labs showed numerous
abnormalities: 
 WBC 10.3 (78% polys)
 Bicarb 47 (AG 17, lactate 2.2)
 VBG w/ pH 7.48, pCO2 74 (which is appropriate compensation, per
Winter's formula)
 K 2.4
 Cr 1.3, BUN 39
 EKG with QTc >580. 

Although he seemed superficially oriented, he was unable to
report the year accurately. Exam otherwise unremarkable. He was
given 1L NS w/ 40 mEq KCl and 40 more mEq of PO KCl. Admitted to
medicine.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ is a ___ yo man with polysubstance abuse (IV heroin and 
cocaine), hepatitis C, HTN, who presented with weakness, dyspnea 
and vomiting.  He was found to have severe metabolic alkalosis, 
hypokalemia, hypophosphatemia, hypermagnesemia, acute kidney 
injury, and acute encephalopathy.  His renal function has 
normalized and electrolyte abnormalities have improved.  His 
mental status improved and he was
AOx3.

ACUTE/ACTIVE PROBLEMS:
# Acute toxic metabolic encephalopathy: On admission, he was 
oriented x2-3.  He does have history of hepatitis C and was 
noted to have asterixis initially, which raised question of 
hepatic encephalopathy, so he was empirically started on 
lactulose. 
However, RUQ ultrasound on ___ showed no evidence of 
cirrhosis, so discontinued scheduled lactulose TID.  Other 
possibility is that his mental status changes were related to 
___ and metabolic abnormalities. Hyperthyroidism could also be a 
possibility, since TSH was suppressed but with normal free T4, 
though no intervention regarding this suppressed TSH. He had no 
focal neurologic deficits and CT head without contrast on ___ 
showed no acute abnormalities, only atrophy.  He had negative 
serum and urine tox screen.  He had negative HIV antibody, 
Treponemal antibody, and B12 was not low.  VBG showed 
hypercapnia but normal pH so this is probably chronic.  He is 
AOx3 and I do not really know how far this is from his baseline, 
but I suspect this is very close. Unfortunately had to use 
Lorazepam PRN for nausea since QTc was prolonged, but he was not 
using frequently and last dose was on ___.  His psychiatrist 
at ___ said at baseline he has been AOx3 and not exhibiting 
cognitive problems.  He was evaluated by physical therapy and 
had no need for home ___ or SNF.

# Nausea/vomiting: Unclear etiology, but likely caused his 
metabolic alkalosis, which was improved since admission.  His 
frequent bowel movements were probably worsened by lactulose, 
which was continued.  Closer to discharge, his episodes of 
vomiting did not appear to be true emesis, but rather spitting 
up of saliva.  He was given PRN Ativan 0.5mg Q6H, but he was not 
using >24 hours prior to discharge, so not prescribed on 
discharge.  Unable to use other agents due to prolonged QTc of 
598 on ___ and 572 on ___.  Ordered to get KUB on ___ for 
further evaluation (though benign abdominal exam) but patient 
refused.  

# Acute kidney injury: Initial creatinine was elevated to 
1.3-1.4, though no recent baseline available.  Back in ___ 
creatinine was 0.7.  Suspect he had acute kidney injury 
secondary to hypovolemia due to nausea and vomiting, as 
creatinine has improved to 0.9 after IV fluids.  He was 
tolerating oral intake and creatinine was 0.9 on discharge.

# Hypokalemia: 
# Hypophosphatemia: Resolved
# Hypochloremia: Resolved
He was given IV and oral repletion for low potassium and 
phosphorus.  He had normal phosphorus of 2.9 on discharge, but 
since this was while on oral repletion QID, he was discharged 
with BID Neutra-Phos to maintain normal level.  His K was 3.1 
and he was given 60meq the day of discharge and prescribed 40meq 
daily on discharge, since needing nearly daily repletion.  He 
should have BMP, calcium, magnesium, phosphorus checked as an 
outpatient within the next 5 days, as he may be able to stop the 
potassium and phosphorus supplements.

# Metabolic alkalosis
# Respiratory acidosis: Most likely his electrolyte deficiencies 
and alkalosis are primarily related to volume depletion and 
vomiting, as both are improving. Unclear why he has respiratory 
acidosis (pCO2 74-->60s) but pH is normal, which is more
suspicious for chronic issue.  CXR showed hyperinflated lungs 
and he is a smoker, so may have undiagnosed COPD.

# Leukocytosis: Mild, with WBC ___, without fevers.  Urine 
culture contaminated on ___.  Resolved. Blood cultures from 
___ had no growth to date.

# Normocytic anemia: Hb was 15 on admission and decreased to 
___, but all counts decreased and he'd gotten IV fluids in 
setting of repeated vomiting, so probably hemoconcentrated 
initially.  He denies blood in emesis and has not had blood in
stool.  Hb was 12 on discharge.

# HTN: SBP mostly in 120s-130s, but up to 160s at times.  He is 
not on anti-hypertensive medication at baseline and was not 
started as inpatient.

# Polysubstance abuse: He recently relapsed on heroin and 
stopped his Suboxone and also admits to frequent cocaine use.  
His suboxone was held in setting of acute metabolic issues.  He 
was unclear about when he'd stopped taking his Suboxone - on 
admission he'd said that he had already stopped (unclear why), 
but prior to discharge, he said that he'd been on it until he 
came to the hospital.  Social work was following.  Addiction 
psychiatry was consulted for assistance with restarting 
Suboxone.  His psychiatrist is Dr. ___, who 
prescribes his  suboxone.  I spoke with her by phone at 
___.  He last saw her on ___, and sees every 4 
weeks.  Urine screen back then was clean and has been clean for 
years, except intermittently positive for cocaine, which he does 
admit to using sometimes.  He will need close follow up with Dr. 
___ addiction psychiatry gave him a prescription for 8mg 
suboxone to bridge until he can see Dr. ___.

# QTc prolongation: QTc 572 on ___ and should be monitored with 
serial EKGs as outpatient.

# Severe malnutrition: 
# Weight loss, abnormal, unintentional: Unclear etiology, may be 
related to above acute issues but need to keep in mind other 
more sinister etiologies. Never had colonoscopy, no TB contacts, 
no symptoms of TB. Negative HIV test.  Nutrition was consulted.  
He was eating while hospitalized and tolerating most oral 
intake.  He was given daily multivitamin and thiamine 
supplement. He needs age appropriate cancer screening, including 
colonoscopy, but can be done as outpatient.

# Hepatitis C: Will need referral to GI doctor for outpatient 
follow up

# Tobacco use: Daily nicotine patch

TRANSITION OF CARE ISSUES:
- I personally called his psychiatrist and PCP's offices to make 
follow up appointments and the soonest appointments were in 
___, so booked those appointments but trying to see if he can 
get sooner appointment.  If so, please call him directly to let 
him know.  I gave him a prescription for CBC, BMP, Ca, Mg, Phos 
that he could take to a lab near him and have results be faxed 
to his PCP.
- Recheck CBC, BMP, Ca, Mg, Phos within 5 days of discharge
- If he has persistent abdominal pain and vomiting, may need 
further imaging and workup, but the patient declined while here
- Outpatient workup for possible COPD given respiratory acidosis 
and is a smoker
- Follow up blood cultures from ___ - no growth to date
- Will need referral to GI doctor for outpatient follow up for 
hepatitis C that is untreated
- He will need repeat EKG to monitor prolonged QTc.  Avoid QTc 
prolonging medications
- He needs age appropriate cancer screening, including 
colonoscopy, but can be
done as outpatient

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___,

It was a pleasure caring for you.

You were admitted for nausea and were found to have acute kidney 
injury. We think this was due to a combination of dehydration, 
poor oral intake, and drug use. You got better with IV fluids 
and monitoring and repletion of your electrolytes.  Your kidney 
function is back to normal.  It's important to stay well 
hydrated.  If you're having worsening nausea and vomiting and 
cannot keep fluids down, then call your doctor or go to the 
emergency department if severe.  Your potassium and phosphorus 
have been low, so you have been started on a potassium and 
phosphorus supplement.  You have a prescription to have lab work 
done, which you can take to any lab near you, and have the 
results faxed to your primary doctor.
 
We recommend you not use cocaine or heroin and continue to 
follow up with a primary care doctor and psychiatrists, as you 
have appointments scheduled with both.  Recommend having kidney 
function and electrolytes checked with your primary doctor to 
make sure these are normal. You will need a referral to a 
gastroenterologist (GI doctor) for your hepatitis C and your 
primary care doctor can help set this up.
 
Followup Instructions:
___
","Certainly! Here are the coding reasons based on the provided medical record:

**E860: Dehydration**
- Reason: The patient presented with symptoms of nausea, vomiting, and weakness, which are consistent with dehydration. Additionally, the initial creatinine was elevated (1.3-1.4), suggesting acute kidney injury secondary to hypovolemia due to dehydration, which improved with IV fluids.

**R64: Cachexia**
- Reason: The patient is described as cachectic, and there is evidence of significant weight loss and poor nutritional status, which aligns with the diagnosis of cachexia.

**F1120: Opioid dependence, uncomplicated**
- Reason: The patient has a history of IV drug abuse, specifically heroin, and has recently relapsed. He was on Suboxone, which was held during his hospitalization due to acute metabolic issues.

**Z681: Body mass index [BMI] 19.9 or less, adult**
- Reason: The patient is described as cachectic and has significant weight loss, suggesting a low BMI. However, specific BMI measurements are not provided in the record, so this code is inferred based on the clinical description.

**E874: Mixed disorder of acid-base balance**
- Reason: The patient had a mixed acid-base disorder, with metabolic alkalosis and respiratory acidosis. Labs showed a high bicarbonate level (47) and a high pCO2 (74), indicating both conditions.

**E878: Other disorders of electrolyte and fluid balance, not elsewhere classified**
- Reason: The patient had multiple electrolyte abnormalities, including hypokalemia, hypophosphatemia, and hypochloremia, which are not fully captured by more specific codes.

**I4581: Long QT syndrome**
- Reason: The patient had a prolonged QTc interval, which was noted on his EKG (QTc >580 initially, 572 on a later measurement). This condition requires monitoring and avoidance of certain medications.

**E861: Hypovolemia**
- Reason: The patient had signs of hypovolemia, which contributed to his acute kidney injury. His creatinine levels improved with IV fluid administration, indicating that hypovolemia was a significant factor.

**D649: Anemia, unspecified**
- Reason: The patient had normocytic anemia, with hemoglobin levels decreasing from 15.0 on admission to 12.0 on discharge. While the anemia is not specified as a particular type, the code D649 captures the general condition.

**B1920: Unspecified viral hepatitis C without hepatic coma**
- Reason: The patient has a history of hepatitis C, and while there was no evidence of cirrhosis on the RUQ ultrasound, the condition is still relevant and requires follow-up with a gastroenterologist.

**I10: Essential (primary) hypertension**
- Reason: The patient has a history of hypertension, and his blood pressure readings during the hospital stay were variable, with some readings in the hypertensive range.

**F319: Bipolar disorder, unspecified**
- Reason: The patient has a documented history of bipolar disorder, which is part of his past medical history.

**G8929: Other chronic pain**
- Reason: The patient has a history of chronic pain, which is mentioned in his past medical history.

**F17200: Nicotine dependence, unspecified, uncomplicated**
- Reason: The patient uses nicotine patches for smoking cessation, indicating a history of nicotine dependence.

**E876: Hypokalemia**
- Reason: The patient had significant hypokalemia (K 2.4 on admission, which improved to 3.1 on discharge). He required IV and oral potassium repletion.

**D72829: Elevated white blood cell count, unspecified**
- Reason: The patient had a mild leukocytosis (WBC 10.3) without fever, which resolved during the hospital stay. The elevated WBC count is noted but not specifically linked to an infection.

**F1410: Cocaine abuse, uncomplicated**
- Reason: The patient admits to ongoing cocaine use and has a history of cocaine abuse, which is part of his substance abuse history.

**R112: Nausea with vomiting, unspecified**
- Reason: The patient presented with nausea and vomiting, which were the chief complaints leading to his hospitalization. These symptoms contributed to his dehydration and electrolyte imbalances.","You are a coder who is proficient in ICD10. Now, please analyze and give reasons for the coding based on the medical record text and ICD10 coding results.

History of Present Illness:
Squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus, surgical discussion 
after completion of neoadjuvant chemoradiation

History of present illness: Mr. ___ is a ___ ___ 
speaking man with a medical history notable for hypertension, 
hyperlipidemia and peptic ulcer disease who was previously seen 
in general surgery clinic in late ___ for evaluation of a newly 
diagnosed T3NxM0 esophageal squamous cell carcinoma.  He now 
presents today for ongoing discussion of possible esophagectomy 
after having recently completed neoadjuvant chemoradiation 
(carboplatin/taxol) on ___. 

Mr. ___ reports that since initiating treatment for his 
esophageal cancer he has had ongoing chest wall pain which is 
constant but tolerable with oxycodone.  He otherwise reports 
that his symptoms of odynophagia and dysphagia have improved 
since completing his course of treatment.  He states that while 
formerly he was unable to tolerate solids or liquids, he is now 
able to stay appropriately nourished and is no longer losing 
weight, although he has been unable to regain the ___ pounds 
he lost with his initial illness.  He states that his energy 
level remains good, and that he is able to perform his 
activities of daily living without significant impairment.

He underwent repeat PET/CT imaging on ___ after 
completing his treatment which demonstrated an interval decrease 
in the previously noted circumferential wall thickening seen 
within his distal esophagus previously, with decreased FDG 
uptake, currently with an SUV max of 8.5 from 17.9.  There were 
several newly seen mildly FDG positive mediastinal and hilar 
lymph nodes noted bilaterally, which were not noted to be 
pathologically enlarged, and thought to be reactive.  In light 
of this good response to treatment, Mr. ___ resents today for 
discussion of medical management of his esophageal cancer.

Review of systems is positive as outlined above.  He otherwise 
denies any nausea, vomiting, fevers, chills, cough, anorexia, 
diarrhea, dysuria, bony pains, headaches, changes in his vision, 
worsening fatigue, skin changes, or changes in his bowel or 
bladder habits.

Since last being seen in clinic, Mr. ___ denies any interval
changes in his medical, surgical, family, or social histories.

spirometry were encouraged throughout hospitalization and the 
patient was weaned entirely from supplemental oxygen.  
 #GI/GU/FEN: The patient had a foley placed intra-operatively, 
which was removed post-surgery on with autonomous return of 
voiding. Nutrition was consulted and tube feeds were started via 
the J-tube.  He received Osmolite 1.5, which was ultimately 
cycled nocturnally once the patient was tolerating a full liquid 
diet. The patient tolerated both full liquids and enteral 
nutrition. He will continue enteral nutrition supplementation 
upon discharge given his inability to progress past full 
liquids; teaching was performed with the presence of an 
interpreter.
 #ID: The patient's fever curves were closely watched for signs 
of infection, of which there were none.  
 #HEME: Patient received BID SQH for DVT prophylaxis, in 
addition to encouraging early ambulation and Venodyne 
compression devices.  
#REHAB: The patient was evaluated by physical therapy who felt 
that the patient was appropriate for discharge to home with 
additional ___ visits at home; please see page 3 for detailed 
recommendations.
  At the time of discharge, the patient was doing well, afebrile 
with stable vital signs. The patient was tolerating diet as 
above per oral, ambulating, voiding without assistance, and pain 
was well controlled. The patient was discharged home with 
services (enteral nutrition, tube care teaching and physical 
therapy). The patient received discharge teaching and follow-up 
instructions with understanding verbalized and agreement with 
the discharge plan.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___, 
It was a pleasure taking care of you here at ___ 
___. You were admitted to our hospital for 
a laparoscopic esophagogastrectomy on ___. You tolerated the 
procedure well and are ambulating, stooling, tolerating a 
regular diet, and your pain is controlled by pain medications by 
mouth. You are now ready to be discharged to home. Please follow 
the recommendations below to ensure a speedy and uneventful 
recovery.  

 ACTIVITY:  
 - Do not drive until you have stopped taking pain medicine and 
feel you could respond in an emergency.  
 - You may climb stairs. You should continue to walk several 
times a day.  
 - You may go outside, but avoid traveling long distances until 
you see your surgeon at your next visit.  
 - You may start some light exercise when you feel comfortable. 
Slowly increase your activity back to your baseline as 
tolerated.  
 - Heavy exercise may be started after 6 weeks, but use common 
sense and go slowly at first.  
 - No heavy lifting (10 pounds or more) until cleared by your 
surgeon, usually about 6 weeks.  
 - You may resume sexual activity unless your doctor has told 
you otherwise.  

 HOW YOU MAY FEEL:  
 - You may feel weak or ""washed out"" for 6 weeks. You might want 
to nap often. Simple tasks may exhaust you.  
 - You may have a sore throat because of a tube that was in your 
throat during the surgery.  

 YOUR BOWELS:  
 - Constipation is a common side effect of narcotic pain 
medicine such as oxycodone. If needed, you may take a stool 
softener (such as Colace, liquid) or gentle laxative (such as 
milk of magnesia, 1 tbs) twice a day. You can get both of these 
medicines without a prescription.  
 - If you go 48 hours without a bowel movement, or have pain 
moving the bowels, call your surgeon.  
 - After some operations, diarrhea can occur. If you get 
diarrhea, don't take anti-diarrhea medicines. Drink plenty of 
fluids and see if it goes away. If it does not go away, or is 
severe and you feel ill, please call your surgeon.  

 PAIN MANAGEMENT:  
 - You are being discharged with a prescription for liquid 
oxycodone for pain control. You may take liquid Tylenol as 
directed, not to exceed 3000mg in 24 hours. Take regularly for a 
few days after surgery but you may skip a dose or increase time 
between doses if you are not having pain until you no longer 
need it. You may take the oxycodone for moderate and severe pain 
not controlled by the Tylenol. You may take a stool softener 
while on narcotics to help prevent the constipation that they 
may cause. Slowly wean off these medications as tolerated.  
 - Your pain should get better day by day. If you find the pain 
is getting worse instead of better, please contact your surgeon. 
 
 If you experience any of the following, please contact your 
surgeon:  
 - sharp pain or any severe pain that lasts several hours  
 - chest pain, pressure, squeezing, or tightness  
 - cough, shortness of breath, wheezing  
 - pain that is getting worse over time or pain with fever  
 - shaking chills, fever of more than 101  
 - a drastic change in nature or quality of your pain  
 - nausea and vomiting, inability to tolerate fluids, food, or 
your medications  
 - if you are getting dehydrated (dry mouth, rapid heart beat, 
feeling dizzy or faint especially while standing)  
 -any change in your symptoms or any symptoms that concern you  
 Additional:  
 *- pain that is getting worse over time, or going to your chest 
or back  
 *- urinary: burning or blood in your urine or the inability to 
urinate  

 MEDICATIONS:  
 - Take all the medicines you were on before the operation just 
as you did before, unless you have been told differently.  
Please follow the instructions on your medication list for 
opening or crushing medications that are not in liquid form.
 - If you have any questions about what medicine to take or not 
to take, please call your surgeon.  

 WOUND CARE:  
 -Dressing Removal:***  
 -You may shower with any bandage strips that may be covering 
your wound. Do not scrub and do not soak or swim, and pat the 
incision dry. If you have steri strips, they will fall off by 
themselves in ___ weeks. If any are still on in two weeks and 
the edges are curling up, you may carefully peel them off.  
 *** Your staples will be removed by your surgeon at your follow 
up appointment.  
 -Do not take baths, soak, or swim for 6 weeks after surgery 
unless told otherwise by your surgical team.  
 -Notify your surgeon if you notice abnormal (foul smelling, 
bloody, pus, etc) or increased drainage from your incision site, 
opening of your incision, or increased pain or bruising. Watch 
for signs of infection such as redness, streaking of your skin, 
swelling, increased pain, or increased drainage.  

 Please call with any questions or concerns. Thank you for 
allowing us to participate in your care. We hope you have a 
quick return to your usual life and activities.

History of Present Illness:
Ms ___ is a ___ y.o. ___ woman with H/O 
hypertension, hyperlipidemia, type diabetes mellitus, prior 
bradycardia and reported prior stroke who presents from her PCP 
office for bradycardia. 

The following information was obtained via ___ 
interpreter, patient, and daughter. There were no records from 
___ (where she has been hospitalized previously) available. 

Patient reported a cough productive of white phlegm beginning ~1 
week ago. In the past 3 days, she felt the cough was getting 
worse. She denied fevers, chills, night sweats and denied any 
sick contacts. Additionally, she reported having mid, 
sub-sternal chest pain beginning ~3 days ago in conjunction with 
worsening cough. The pain was intermittent, and she 
characterized it as ""sharp, tight"" that occurs throughout the 
day, non-positional, not associated with exertion, and if 
anything, occurs after she eats. At times, the pressure would 
radiate to her back. She said she had a similar chest pain ___ 
year ago as well, requiring ___ ED evaluation. Daughter says she 
may have ""blocked vessel."" 

She subsequently presented to her PCP who found her to be 
bradycardic (patient cannot recall actual value and no PCP 
records available at time of admission). Of note, she took her 
amlodipine this morning for BP and has been on this medication 
for years. She was subsequently sent to ___ ED for further 
evaluation. 

In the ED, initial VS: T 98.7, HR 32, BP 137/77, RR 18, SpO2 98% 
on RA. HR thereafter ranged from ~30s to 58. Exam was 
unremarkable. Labs were notable for WBC 10.6, Mg 1.6, for which 
she received MgSO4 2 gm IV. proBNP 237. Troponin-T was negative 
twice. Initial EKG showed sinus bradycardia, VR 37 bpm with 
junctional rhythm. CXR showed cardiomegaly with possible 
vascular congestion.   She was seen by the Electrophysiology 
Service who felt junctional rhythm and bradycardia were due to 
cough with dry heaves. She was also seen by Cardiology who felt 
low suspicion for ACS.

After arrival to the cardiology ward, she reported the chest 
pain had improved, as she has not eaten. Again, she said the 
pain is worse after meals. She reported an ongoing cough, but 
denied dyspnea, palpitations, possible infectious insult, 
thyroid disease, OSA, known prior h/o infilitrative or systemic 
disease aside from those mentioned.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms ___ is a ___ y.o. ___ woman with H/O 
hypertension, hyperlipidemia, type 2 diabetes mellitus, prior 
bradycardia and reported prior stroke who presented from PCP 
office for asymptomatic bradycardia without evidence to suggest 
an ischemic etiology.

# Asymptomatic bradycardia: Patient was noted to have HR ___ 
with EKG demonstrating junctional rhythm with occasional PVCs. 
She was evaluated by Electrophysiology in the ED without 
recommendation for pacemaker. Her troponin-T was negative x 3 
with non-ischemic EKG arguing against ACS as an etiology. 
Echocardiogram was normal. Her bradycardia was likely 
exacerbated by increased vagal tone in setting of her cough with 
possible contribution from amlodipine. TSH mildly elevated to 
5.8, free T4 and T3 were normal. Lyme Ab ultimately returned 
negative. Cardiology follow up recommended on discharge. A 
Ziopatch was placed on discharge to assess arrhythmia burden.

# Acute on chronic cough: Patient reported a chronic cough which 
was worse in the last week productive of white phlegm. This was 
likely related to GERD with possible additional component of a 
viral illness or allergic rhinitis. She was provided with 
prescriptions for benzonatate and guaifenesin on discharge. 

# Chest Pain: Patient endorsed chest pain for years, worse in 
the last week since her cough began. History of mild 
atherosclerosis and slow flow on coronary angiogram in ___ at ___ during evaluation for chest pain. Features were 
atypical for ischemia with absence of troponin elevation or EKG 
changes that would have suggested ACS. Given relationship with 
eating and improvement with Maalox, suspect this is likely GERD. 
She was continued on famotidine, Maalox and omeprazole.

# Hypertension: BP elevated at admission. Amlodipine was stopped 
in setting of bradycardia (a reported side effect) and losartan 
was increased to 100 mg daily.

# CAD: Coronary angiography at ___ in ___ with 
non-obstructive CAD per above. Continue ASA 81 mg daily, 
atorvastatin 40 mg qhs, losartan increased to 100 mg daily.

CHRONIC ISSUES: 
# Type 2 diabetes mellitus: Held home metformin 500 mg bid and 
maintained on HISS. Metformin restarted on discharge. 

# Hyperlipidemia: Continued atorvastatin as above

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
[] Recommend follow up with Dr. ___ cardiology at ___ 
___, appointment scheduled for ___.
[] Losartan was increased to 100 mg daily. Amlodipine was 
discontinued. Please titrate BP meds further as needed for 
anti-hypertensive management.
[] Overnight desaturation was noted while sleeping. Please 
consider further evaluation with a sleep study. 
[] Consider ETT to assess for exercise induced hypotension or 
arrhythmia.
[] Ziopatch placed on discharge to evaluate arrhythmia burden

Followup Instructions:
___
","Certainly! Here are the reasons for the ICD-10 codes based on the evidence in the original medical record:

- **R001: Bradycardia, unspecified**
  - Reason: The patient presented with bradycardia, and her heart rate ranged from 30s to 58 bpm. The EKG showed sinus bradycardia and junctional rhythm. The bradycardia was attributed to increased vagal tone from coughing and possibly amlodipine use.

- **R05: Cough**
  - Reason: The patient reported a chronic cough that worsened over the past week, productive of white phlegm. This was managed with medications for cough relief.

- **K219: Gastro-esophageal reflux disease without esophagitis**
  - Reason: The patient had a history of chest pain that was atypical for ischemia and improved with antacids. The chest pain was suspected to be related to GERD, and she was continued on famotidine, Maalox, and omeprazole.

- **R1013: Epigastric pain**
  - Reason: The patient reported mid, sub-sternal chest pain that was sharp and tight, occurring after meals. This pain was suspected to be related to GERD.

- **R0902: Hypoxemia**
  - Reason: The patient had nocturnal hypoxemia with desaturation noted while sleeping, suggesting a need for further evaluation with a sleep study.

- **R946: Abnormal results of thyroid function studies**
  - Reason: The patient""s TSH was mildly elevated to 5.8, although free T4 and T3 levels were normal. This indicates an abnormal thyroid function test result.

- **R079: Chest pain, unspecified**
  - Reason: The patient reported chest pain that was atypical for ischemia and was suspected to be related to GERD. However, the chest pain was not specified as a particular type in the discharge diagnosis.

- **Z8673: Personal history of transient ischemic attack (TIA), and cerebral infarction without residual deficits**
  - Reason: The patient had a reported history of a prior stroke, which was noted in both the past medical history and the discharge diagnosis.

- **E785: Hyperlipidemia, unspecified**
  - Reason: The patient has a history of hyperlipidemia and was continued on atorvastatin for lipid management.

- **I2510: Atherosclerotic heart disease of native coronary artery without angina pectoris**
  - Reason: The patient has a history of CAD risk factors and a prior coronary angiogram showed non-obstructive CAD. She was continued on aspirin and atorvastatin for cardiovascular protection.

- **E1122: Type 2 diabetes mellitus with diabetic chronic kidney disease**
  - Reason: The patient has type 2 diabetes mellitus and chronic kidney disease, stage 2, as indicated by her elevated creatinine and other renal function tests.

- **I129: Hypertensive chronic kidney disease with stage 1 through stage 4 chronic kidney disease, or unspecified chronic kidney disease**
  - Reason: The patient has hypertension and chronic kidney disease, stage 2, which is a common comorbidity in hypertensive patients.

- **N182: Chronic kidney disease, stage 2 (mild)**
  - Reason: The patient""s renal function tests, including creatinine, indicate chronic kidney disease, stage 2, which is mild.

History of Present Illness:
___ yo ___ speaking F w/HTN, HLD, CVA ___ years ago (right
hemiplegia with residual right facial droop), and CAD presenting
with 5 days of headache and around 3 days of blurry vision in
right eye and right sided sensory changes. 

Patient is a poor and tangential historian. Of note, her history
changes within the exam and between providers.

5 days ago patient began having a throbbing headache, feels
""inside"" but also on right temporal area. It was intermittent at
first, worse with sitting up and exertion. 3 days ago HA became
constant. She denies vertigo but endorses feeling unsteady on 
her
feet, she denies N/V, photo/phonophobia. She took some Tylenol
which minimally helped. She doe not typically have headaches and
does not have migraines. She does note HA tends to improve after
she takes her BP medications. Her BP has been 150-170s on home
readings. PCP had adjusted her antihypertensive medications from
combined HCTZ/losartan (unknown dosing) to 2 separate pills. She
was also about to start amlodipine 5 mg daily.

Around 3 days ago she began to have blurry vision of her right
eye as well as numbness in her right face. She doesn't know 
exact
onset. She believes she is also having intermittent numbness in
her right arm and leg for the past 3 days as well. She notes
increased drooping from right side of mouth. 

Prior stroke was around ___ years ago. Resulted in right
hemiplegia. Still has mild right facial droop. Notes she is
slower to respond since the stroke. She takes an ASA 81 mg daily
and atorvastatin 40 mg qhs.

Of note, recent hospital admission ___ for asymptomatic
bradycardia (HR in ___ thought to be secondary to increased
vagal tone as patient coughing frequently. Discharged on
ziopatch. She was having chest pain at this time thought 
unlikely
to be cardiac, and more likely secondary to GERD.

Brief Hospital Course:
___ yo ___ speaking F w/HTN, HLD, CVA ___ years ago (right 
hemiplegia with residual right facial droop), and CAD presenting 
with 5 days of headache and around 3 days of blurry vision in 
right eye, increased right facial droop and right sided sensory 
changes. This is occurring in setting of recent elevated BP in 
the setting of medication adjustment. On presentation SBP 
170s-190s. HA is a throbbing sensation, primarily right side. 
NIHSS 3. Exam noted for decreased ___ eyebrow raising, right 
facial droop (more pronounced than baseline) and right face arm 
and leg decreased sensation. She has 5- right delt and right 
pronation but otherwise full strength. She feels unsteady when 
walking and has somewhat wide based gait. CTH reveals what 
appears to be calcification of left vert and old left lacunar 
infarct.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___,

You were hospitalized for symptoms of Increased right sided 
numbness, Right facial droop and headache. Your symptoms were 
initially suspected to be from a possible stroke or from 
elevated blood pressure. You underwent a MRI scan of brain which 
did not show any evidence of new stroke. We suspect that your 
symptoms are form recrudescence of your previous symptoms in the 
setting of elevated blood pressure.

You were also having headache which is likely from elevated 
Blood pressure and from neck muscle pain. You were given your 
home blood pressure meds and pain medication with improvement.

We recommend you continue medications as stated on the list.

Please follow up with Primary care physician tomorrow as 
scheduled.

Yours sincerely,
___ Neurology team

 
Followup Instructions:
___
","Certainly! Here are the reasons for the ICD-10 codes based on the evidence from the medical record:

**I160: Hypertensive urgency**
- Reason: The patient presented with elevated blood pressure readings (SBP 170s-190s) and symptoms such as a throbbing headache, which were attributed to hypertensive urgency. The diagnosis of hypertensive urgency is explicitly mentioned in the discharge diagnosis and the discharge instructions.

**I2510: Atherosclerotic heart disease of native coronary artery without angina pectoris**
- Reason: The patient""s past medical history includes CAD (coronary artery disease). The medical record mentions that the patient takes aspirin and atorvastatin, which are commonly prescribed for CAD management. There is no mention of angina pectoris, so the code specifies the absence of angina.

**H538: Other visual disturbances**
- Reason: The patient reported blurry vision in her right eye, which started around 3 days before admission. This symptom is documented in the history of present illness and is categorized under other visual disturbances.

**E785: Hyperlipidemia, unspecified**
- Reason: The patient has a history of hyperlipidemia (HLD) and is taking atorvastatin, a lipid-lowering medication. The medical record does not specify the type of hyperlipidemia, so the unspecified code is appropriate.

**I69351: Hemiplegia and hemiparesis following cerebral infarction affecting right dominant side**
- Reason: The patient has a history of a CVA (cerebral vascular accident) that resulted in right hemiplegia and residual right facial droop. This is clearly documented in the past medical history and physical exam findings.

**I69392: Facial weakness following cerebral infarction**
- Reason: The patient has a history of a CVA with residual right facial droop. This is specifically mentioned in the past medical history and physical exam findings, indicating ongoing facial weakness post-stroke.

**E119: Type 2 diabetes mellitus without complications**
- Reason: The patient has a history of T2DM (Type 2 diabetes mellitus) and is taking metformin. The medical record does not mention any specific complications of diabetes, so the code reflects diabetes without complications.

**K219: Gastro-esophageal reflux disease without esophagitis**
- Reason: The patient has a history of GERD (gastroesophageal reflux disease) and is taking omeprazole, a proton pump inhibitor used to manage GERD. The medical record does not specify the presence of esophagitis, so the code reflects GERD without esophagitis.

**R001: Bradycardia, unspecified**
- Reason: The patient had a recent hospital admission for asymptomatic bradycardia, which is documented in the past medical history. The bradycardia was thought to be secondary to increased vagal tone due to frequent coughing. The code reflects the presence of bradycardia without specifying the cause.

These codes accurately reflect the conditions and symptoms documented in the medical record.","You are a coder who is proficient in ICD10. Now, please analyze and give reasons for the coding based on the medical record text and ICD10 coding results.
    The reasons for such coding should be mainly given in combination with the evidence in the original medical record.
    For codes that may not be applicable, do not output the corresponding reasons and do not perform additional analysis.

Brief Hospital Course:
___ yo M with poorly controlled DM2, HTN, HL, presents with 
subacute fatigue, lethargy/confusion, and HA, found to have 
hypertensive urgency, ARF, and hyperglycemia.

Lethargy/Encephalopathy
Poorly controlled DM2 with nephropathy/neuropathy
Hypertensive urgency/Malignancy hypertension
The patient' symptoms were consistent with uncontrolled DM2 and 
HTN causing hypertensive urgency and encephalopathy.  He also 
had ARF.  There was no evidence of infection, cardiac ischemia, 
or acute stroke.  The above were likely exacerbated by poor 
adherence to his medication for the last year.  Clinically he 
improved with blood pressure and FSBG control.  ___ was 
involved.  He was placed on Lantus monotherapy at 25 units qHS 
as well as Glipizide 10mg BID.  Metformin was held due to his 
renal failure.  His A1c was found to be >13.  He will follow up 
with ___ for his diabetes.

Hi blood pressure improved markedly with initiation of his 
amlodipine.  His HCTZ and ACEi were not restarted due to his 
renal failure.  Further titration will be necessary.
- of note he had microscopic hematuria on UA.  This requires 
follow up

IMAGING:
Left Femur 4 views ___
Although there is no convincing fracture, there is a small to
moderate-sized joint effusion, sometimes may be associated with
occult fracture or quadriceps injury. 

CXR ___
Suspected early pulmonary edema.  Patchy airspace opacities at
the lung bases, although may represent alveolar edema, are
suspicious for superimposed infection/aspiration, for clinical
correlation. 

CT CSPINE ___
1. No acute fracture or traumatic malalignment. 
2. Benign-appearing fatty lucency within the left lateral mass 
of
the C2 vertebra, may represent area of fatty marrow adjacent to
the venous plexus, small hemangioma or less likely intraosseous
lipoma. 
3. Given presence chondrocalcinosis in the cervical spine, lower
extremity involving the pubic symphysis and knee, patient may
have CPPD. 
  
CT Lower Extremity ___
1. No acute fracture or dislocation. 
2. There is no joint effusion or lipohemarthrosis.  Apparent
density over the suprapatellar recess, likely artifactual and 
due
to confluent shadow on recent radiograph. 
3. No large retracted quadriceps or patellar tendon tear,
although there is likely remote injury to the rectus femoris on
the basis of chronic appearing dystrophic calcifications. 

CT HEAD  ___
No acute intracranial posttraumatic sequela. 

L ANKLE ___
Diffusely osteopenic bones. No acute displaced fractures or
dislocations. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ year old woman with history of anemia (Hb ___ and HTN (not 
on medication) admitted after a mechanical fall. Trauma survey 
including CT head/C-spine and L knee x-ray notable only for 
moderate knee effusion. Incidentally found to be in AFib on 
routine EKG. Patient declined anticoagulation or further 
evaluation with TTE. CXR on admission abnormal (edema vs 
infection vs inflammation) however patient asymptomatic so did 
not receive treatment. ___ evaluated and recommended rehab 
however patient declined, and was discharged home (she lives 
with children) with ___ and home ___. After thorough discussion, 
patient signed MOLST form changing code status to DNR/DNI.

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
- Newly diagnosed atrial fibrillation, patient declined further 
evaluation with TTE and anticoagulation; daughter/patient 
open/amenable to discussion of aspirin and were made aware of 
its limited efficacy in this scenario
- Abnormal CXR of unclear clinical relevance, can consider 
further evaluation with repeat CXR and possible chest CT if 
patient desires
- Signed MOLST indicating DNR/DNI

ACUTE ISSUES:
#L knee effusion
#Fall: Mechanical, witnessed fall with headstrike onto L knee. 
CT head/neck without bleed or fracture. L knee plain film with 
moderate effusion, no major fracture, unable to rule out smaller 
fracture. AROM and PROM limited by joint effusion. Ligaments 
intact on exam. Evaluated by ___ who recommended rehab however 
patient declined, arranged home ___ and ___. Pain control with 
tylenol, ice, NSAIDs after ~72 hours due to possible 
hemarthrosis.

# Atrial fibrillation: Newly diagnosed, rates well controlled. 
CHADSVASC at least 3 (age, sex). Patient declined 
anticoagulation and understood risks of stroke. Also declined 
TTE. Prior to discharge, the patient's daughter inquired about 
taking aspirin for stroke prevention. I informed her that 
aspirin is not typically recommended given the efficacy of 
anticoagulants; I suggested that the data for aspirin is weak, 
suggesting a possibly a 20% reduction in stroke risk, however, 
also an increase in bleeding risk, similar to that of the 
anticoagulants. I have encouraged her to continue to discuss 
this with her outpatient providers. 

#Abnormal CXR
#Elevated BNP: Patient declines significant respiratory 
symptoms. Did not want further evaluation with TTE given would 
not take any recommended medications or have any procedures.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___,

You were admitted to the hospital after you fell on your knee. 
The physical therapists thought you would benefit from rehab, 
but you preferred to return home. We discussed your abnormal 
heart rhythm, atrial fibrillation, which is where the top 
portions of the heart quiver. This heart rhythm increases your 
risk for stroke and the risk of stroke can be decreased by 
taking a blood thinner medication. We spoke about aspirin as a 
possible alternative. The research suggests that there is some, 
but not a strong benefit of taking aspirin for this reason. I 
encourage you to continue to discuss blood thinners with your 
primary care doctor. 

You should take acetaminophen (tylenol) to treat your pain. 
Taking Tylenol three times a day can really improve pain so that 
you can participate in physical therapy. You should avoid NSAIDs 
(i.e. ibuprofen, naproxen) for the next 2 days as they might 
worsen your knee swelling, but then can start ibuprofen to help 
with pain.

During this hospital stay, we also signed a MOLST form which you 
should put on your refrigerator. We've scheduled a follow up 
appointment for you and hope that you keep it! 

It was a pleasure participating in your care,

Your ___ Team
 
Followup Instructions:
___
","Certainly! Here are the reasons for the ICD-10 coding based on the medical record:

- **M25.562: Pain in left knee**
  - Reason: The patient reports left leg numbness and pain, particularly in the left knee, which is described as ""vague.""

- **M25.462: Effusion, left knee**
  - Reason: Imaging (CT lower extremity) shows a moderate knee effusion, and the patient has limited range of motion due to the effusion.

- **R53.1: Weakness**
  - Reason: While not explicitly mentioned, the patient""s difficulty in moving her left leg and the description of the pain as ""vague"" could imply weakness. However, this code might not be the most specific, and it is not strongly supported by the medical record.

- **S00.81XA: Abrasion of other part of head, initial encounter**
  - Reason: The patient sustained a right forehead abrasion during the fall, which required wound care in the ED.

- **W18.30XA: Fall on same level, unspecified, initial encounter**
  - Reason: The patient experienced a mechanical fall on a sidewalk, which led to the abrasion and knee effusion.

- **Y92.480: Sidewalk as the place of occurrence of the external cause**
  - Reason: The fall occurred on a sidewalk, as specifically mentioned in the history of present illness.

- **R20.0: Anesthesia of skin**
  - Reason: The patient reports left leg numbness, which could be interpreted as anesthesia of the skin.

- **I48.0: Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation**
  - Reason: The patient was found to be in atrial fibrillation on routine EKG, and it is noted as a new diagnosis.

- **R93.89: Abnormal findings on diagnostic imaging of other specified body structures**
  - Reason: The CXR shows suspected early pulmonary edema and patchy airspace opacities, which are noted as suspicious for superimposed infection/aspiration.

- **Z66: Do not resuscitate**
  - Reason: The patient signed a MOLST form changing her code status to DNR/DNI.

- **R79.89: Other specified abnormal findings of blood chemistry**
  - Reason: The patient has an elevated BNP level (proBNP-1092), which is an abnormal finding in blood chemistry.

- **D50.9: Iron deficiency anemia, unspecified**
  - Reason: The patient has a history of iron deficiency anemia, and her lab results show low ferritin and iron levels.

- **I10: Essential (primary) hypertension**
  - Reason: The patient has a history of hypertension, and it is listed in her past medical history.

- **J81.1: Chronic pulmonary edema**
  - Reason: The CXR suggests early pulmonary edema, and the patient has a history of shortness of breath with exertion, which could be related to chronic pulmonary edema.

- **H91.90: Unspecified hearing loss, unspecified ear**
  - Reason: The patient has a history of hearing loss and is described as very hard of hearing, which affects her ability to communicate.

These codes are derived from the detailed information provided in the medical record, including the patient""s symptoms, examination findings, and diagnostic results.","You are a coder who is proficient in ICD10.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ was admitted to the ___ on ___ for surgical 
management of his valvular disease. He was worked-up in the 
usual fashion including a cardiac catheterization which showed 
no significant coronary artery disease. A carotid ultrasound 
showed no significant stenosis. On ___, Mr. ___ was taken 
to the operating room where he underwent a redo sternotomy, Redo 
aortic valve replacement with a 21 mm Epic supra tissue valve, 
Resection of ascending aortic aneurysm and ascending aortic 
replacement with a 30 mm Gelweave tube graft, CABG x 1 with a 
left internal mammary artery graft to left anterior descending 
artery.  Please see operative note for details.  
POD 1 found the patient extubated, alert and oriented and 
breathing comfortably.  The patient was neurologically intact 
and hemodynamically stable.  He did have post-operative 
delirium.  He was transferred to the step down unit POD 1 for 
further recovery.  His chest tubes and wires were removed per 
protocol.  He had a small L pneumothorax, but this has resolved. 
 While on his full-dose home carvedilol 12.5 bid on ___, he had 
6 second ventricular pauses were noted on telemetry, with 
decreased mentation during episodes. His carvedilol was stopped 
and he was transferred to ___ for further management. EP was 
consulted and it was determined he would benefit from a 
permanent pacer.  ___ pacer was placed ___. He was 
gently diuresed toward the preoperative weight with acute kidney 
injury on CRI. His peak creatinine was 2.7 from baseline 1.9.  
On POD 11, he two brief episodes of unresponsiveness after 
standing and Neurology was consulted.  They suspect that his 
symptoms are due to orthostatic hypotension and did not 
recommend further intensive work up.  Fall precautions and 
gentle diuresis were recommended.  He was evaluated by the 
Physical Therapy service for assistance with strength and 
mobility.  He has had persistent mild leukocytosis without 
fevers or obvious signs of infection, so we are requesting 
repeat ___ check on ___ with result called to Dr. ___ 
___.  Repeat UA and Urine culture are also pending.  By the 
time of discharge on POD 13 the patient was ambulating freely, 
the wound was healing and pain was controlled with oral 
analgesics.  The patient was discharged to ___ in 
___ in good condition with appropriate follow up 
instructions.  Some of his preoperative medications are being 
held until his SBP is consistently >120, including his Coreg.

Followup Instructions:
___
","Certainly! Below is the analysis and reasoning for each ICD-10 code based on the provided medical record:

### Primary Diagnoses:
1. **I71.2: Thoracic aortic aneurysm, without rupture**
   - **Reason**: The patient has a history of an ascending aortic aneurysm, and the medical record mentions ""Ascending Aortic Aneurysm"" multiple times. The aneurysm was resected and replaced with a graft, indicating it was not ruptured.

2. **N17.9: Acute kidney failure, unspecified**
   - **Reason**: The patient experienced acute kidney injury during the hospital stay, with peak creatinine levels rising from 1.9 to 2.7. This is documented in the ""Brief Hospital Course"" section.

3. **I50.32: Chronic diastolic (congestive) heart failure**
   - **Reason**: The cardiac catheterization report mentions ""Chronic moderate left ventricular diastolic heart failure."" This is also supported by the TEE findings and the patient""s symptoms of dyspnea on exertion.

4. **I13.0: Hypertensive heart and chronic kidney disease with heart failure and stage 1 through stage 4 chronic kidney disease, or unspecified chronic kidney disease**
   - **Reason**: The patient has a history of hypertension and chronic kidney disease, and the medical record mentions ""Chronic Kidney Disease (baseline Cre 1.9)."" The presence of heart failure is also documented.

5. **D62: Acute posthemorrhagic anemia**
   - **Reason**: This code does not seem applicable based on the provided medical record. There is no mention of hemorrhage or posthemorrhagic anemia.

6. **F03.91: Unspecified dementia, unspecified severity, with behavioral disturbance**
   - **Reason**: The patient was noted to have post-operative delirium, which can be a form of acute confusion or cognitive impairment. However, there is no specific mention of dementia or behavioral disturbance in the medical record.

7. **D69.59: Other secondary thrombocytopenia**
   - **Reason**: The patient has a history of tick-borne illness with thrombocytopenia, which is mentioned in the ""Past Medical History"" section.

8. **K21.0: Gastro-esophageal reflux disease with esophagitis**
   - **Reason**: The patient has a history of esophagitis/gastroesophageal reflux disease, which is mentioned in the ""Past Medical History"" section.

9. **N18.9: Chronic kidney disease, unspecified**
   - **Reason**: The patient has chronic kidney disease with a baseline creatinine level of 1.9, as mentioned in the ""Past Medical History"" section.

10. **E78.5: Hyperlipidemia, unspecified**
    - **Reason**: The patient has a history of hyperlipidemia, which is mentioned in the ""Past Medical History"" section.

11. **I35.0: Nonrheumatic aortic (valve) stenosis**
    - **Reason**: The patient has a history of aortic stenosis, which is mentioned in the ""Past Medical History"" section. The pre-operative TEE and pathology report also confirm this.

12. **I25.10: Atherosclerotic heart disease of native coronary artery without angina pectoris**
    - **Reason**: The cardiac catheterization report mentions ""Calcified two vessel coronary artery disease worst in the mid LAD,"" which indicates atherosclerotic heart disease.

13. **F32.9: Major depressive disorder, single episode, unspecified**
    - **Reason**: The patient has a history of depression, which is mentioned in the ""Past Medical History"" section.

14. **I95.1: Orthostatic hypotension**
    - **Reason**: The patient experienced two brief episodes of unresponsiveness after standing, and Neurology suspected that the symptoms were due to orthostatic hypotension.

15. **D72.829: Elevated white blood cell count, unspecified**
    - **Reason**: The patient had persistent mild leukocytosis without fevers or obvious signs of infection, as mentioned in the ""Brief Hospital Course"" section.

16. **I45.10: Unspecified right bundle-branch block**
    - **Reason**: This code does not seem applicable based on the provided medical record. There is no mention of right bundle-branch block.

17. **I44.1: Atrioventricular block, second degree**
    - **Reason**: The patient had 6-second ventricular pauses noted on telemetry, which led to the placement of a permanent pacemaker. This suggests a high-grade AV nodal block, which can include second-degree AV block.

18. **I80.8: Phlebitis and thrombophlebitis of other sites**
    - **Reason**: This code does not seem applicable based on the provided medical record. There is no mention of phlebitis or thrombophlebitis.

19. **Z95.3: Presence of xenogenic heart valve**
    - **Reason**: The patient had a bioprosthetic aortic valve implanted, which is a xenogenic heart valve. This is mentioned in the ""Operative Note"" and ""Pathology"" sections.

### Secondary Diagnoses:
1. **F32.9: Major depressive disorder, single episode, unspecified**
   - **Reason**: The patient has a history of depression, which is mentioned in the ""Past Medical History"" section.

2. **K21.0: Gastro-esophageal reflux disease with esophagitis**
   - **Reason**: The patient has a history of esophagitis/gastroesophageal reflux disease, which is mentioned in the ""Past Medical History"" section.

3. **D69.59: Other secondary thrombocytopenia**
   - **Reason**: The patient has a history of tick-borne illness with thrombocytopenia, which is mentioned in the ""Past Medical History"" section.

4. **E78.5: Hyperlipidemia, unspecified**
   - **Reason**: The patient has a history of hyperlipidemia, which is mentioned in the ""Past Medical History"" section.

5. **I13.0: Hypertensive heart and chronic kidney disease with heart failure and stage 1 through stage 4 chronic kidney disease, or unspecified chronic kidney disease**

History of Present Illness:
Dear Doctors:

I had the pleasure of visiting with ___ today, in the
___.

As you know, he is a ___ man who I have known for
sometime.  Actually, I last visited with him about one to
one-half years ago, on ___, when he was suffering
significant L5 radiculopathy, from L5 nerve root compression
within the L5-S1 neural foramen.

At that time, he was considering undergoing surgery for this,
which I did think was a reasonable choice.  I told him that he
had L5 nerve root compression in the foramen at L5-S1, and I
suggested to him that a minimally invasive transforaminal lumbar
interbody fusion would be the most appropriate operation to
decompress the L5 nerve.

Unfortunately, he sought care with a surgeon, a neurosurgeon of
___, called Dr. ___.  Dr. ___ him with 
a
different surgery, which was a posterior L5-S1 decompression. 
The patient did not experience any relief of his symptoms, and 
he
continues with his L5 symptoms to this day.

I expressed empathy to Mr. ___, but also understanding that
operation he underwent would not be expected to decompress his
exiting L5 nerve root.  The reason for this is that the disc is
rather collapse, and he has considerable foraminal stenosis
related to the L5 pedicle being in close proximity to the S1
pedicle because of the loss of disc height.  There is also a 
disc
material within the foramen, and facet and ligamentum anterior
within the foramen, that were not removed by his operation at 
the
___, I would not be expected to be considered different by
his operation done at the ___.

He has undergone a new course of conservative care, and he has
also undergone a new lumbar spine imaging.

The patient explains to me that his symptoms continue to be
radiating in his left leg, and to the lateral aspect of his left
ankle, and to the top of the left foot.  This is very
characteristic of the L5 distribution, and at the same
distribution of his pain that he had before his operation that
would be more appropriate to decompress the S1 nerve root.

Imaging:  I did review the MRI of the lumbar spine, which was
performed after his most recent operation, which is ___.
 I did also review the radiologist's report of the study, which
was dictated by Dr. ___.  I did compare these images to the
prior MRI from ___.  The prior MRI is the one that I
used to make the recommendations of L5 decompression.  The new
images demonstrate 4-5 mm retrolisthesis of L5 and S1, unchanged
from ___.  The disc height loss at L5-S1 is also unchanged,
which is severe.  The foraminal stenosis at L5-S1 is also
unchanged, and is severe bilaterally, with particular 
compression
of the exiting L5 nerve root.  Since the prior MRI, there has
been L5-S1 hemilaminectomy performed, but without any 
significant
change in the lateral recess or foraminal stenosis. 
Additionally, there is an L4-L5 disc protrusion, which is more
significant than the prior exam, but not causing any significant
neurologic compression or impingement of the nerve root.

Impression and Plan:  ___ is a ___ man who has
longstanding L5 nerve root compression, because of foraminal
stenosis affecting his exiting L5 nerve root.  This is 
correlated
with the symptoms, and has been unchanged for many years, and 
has
been unchanged by a dorsal L5-S1 decompression that would be
expected to not improve his symptomatology.

I expressed to him as I did at the last visit that a minimally
invasive transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion will be the best
operation to address this.  I have provided with him handmade 
ink
drawing to help explain the technical details of the operation,
and the rationale for why that operation will be the most
appropriate one.  It could be performed by ___ approach
bilaterally, without interfering with his midline incisions from
his previous operations.  I do think it would be adequate in
providing decompression of the exiting nerve roots, 
stabilization
of the segment, and improvement of the foraminal height and
volume, which I hope will be concordant with relief of his
symptoms.

I also explained to him that one of the risks of surgery is
failure of the operation to resolve the symptoms, which is a
significant risk for him given the prolonged nature of his nerve
compression, and the prolonged nature of his symptomatology.  I
do not think it is too late, however, particularly since his
symptoms do wax and wane, and there is considerable optimism 
that
the surgery may indeed help his L5 nerve symptoms.

We had a long discussion regarding this, the alternatives, risks
and benefits of both surgical and ongoing nonsurgical care, the
risks of adjacent segment disease and the technicality of the
operation including the materials used in the surgical
reconstruction, bone grafting, and others.

We look forward to providing with the surgery in the future to
help him accomplish the goal of treatment, which include
reduction in his leg pain, and improvement in his tolerance of
functional activities.

We look forward to speaking to him again in the interim and 
asked
him to call me with any questions or concerns.

Thanks again for allowing us to participate in the care of your
patient.

Brief Hospital Course:
On arrival Ms. ___ was fevrile, tachycardic, and tachypneic. 
FHT showed fetal tachycardia to the 180s. Labs showed 
leukocytosis to 18, pyuria, urine nitrites. Prior to transfer to 
___ she received ceftriaxone 1g and 2L of IVF. On transfer she 
was hypotensive to 80/40, with Tmax 104.7, HR 130-140s, satting 
95% on RA. With further resuscitation, her blood pressure 
improved, however she remained tachycardic. She was treated with 
vancomycin and zosyn. Renal ultrasound showed severe right 
hydroureteronephrosis, and so she underwent placement of right 
percutaneous nephrostomy on ___. 

Due to sustained tachycardia, she had a CTA to evaluate for 
pulmonary embolism.  Shortly after completion of the scan, while 
patient was still in radiology department, she became 
tachypneic, hypotensive, with more rapid HR to 140-150s, and 
hypoxemic to SPO2 in the ___ on room air. She was placed on 
non-rebreather and transferred back to the L&D unit. There she 
rapidly developed worsening respiratory distress.  On exam, she 
remained tachycardic but was normotensive; she was tachypneic, 
and auscultation showed bilateral rales and rhonchi. Unclear if 
patient had other complaints at this time. Due to severe 
distress, she was intubated (received propofol and 
succinylcholine). She was also given Lasix 20mg IV, with brisk 
urine output following administration. 

She was transferred to the ___ ICU for further care. 

ICU COURSE:

# Acute hypoxemic respiratory failure: 
Patient developed acute hypoxemia shortly after CTA, done for 
suspicion of PE because of unexplained tachycardia. Prior to CTA 
patient had been on room air. Exam demonstrated diffuse rales 
and wheezing. CTA motion degraded, but negative for significant 
PE, does show potential pneumonia. Initially considered ARDS due 
to pyelonephritis in pregnancy, although the rapid onset of 
hypoxemia would be unusual for this; P/F ratio 190. Also 
considered bronchospastic reaction to iodinated contrast 
(although did not have angioedema, hives, hypotension, that may 
be expected with anaphylaxis). Patient was given IV Lasix and 
had a very rapid response to diuresis raising a question of 
acute pulmonary edema due to fluid overload, although this was 
not reflected on exam or imaging. Patient was also started on 
broad spectrum antibiotics and was subsequently extubated within 
24 hours. She was de-escalated to ceftriaxone and azithromycin 
for treatment of CAP. ECHO with normal LVEF and no e/o systolic 
dysfunction. 

#Hypotension/Sepsis due to pyelonephritis:
Cultures from CHA growing pan-sensitive E. Coli. Hydronephrosis 
seen on ultrasound this admission has been present on ultrasound 
in ___ and ___ at ___. Has no imaging demonstrating 
presence of obstructing stone this admission, and with 
questionable chronic pyelo, unable to ensure she has new 
obstruction. Due to potential new obstruction, however, she had 
placement of right perc nephrostomy, currently in place. 
Initially on vanc/zosyn then de-escalated to ceftriaxone and 
azithromycin as above to cover both urine and pulmonary 
pathogens.

POST-ICU COURSE / ANTEPARTUM COURSE:

She was transferred out of the ICU in stable condition. She was 
monitored on telemetry and her pain was controlled initially 
with IV pain medications. She was transitioned to PO pain 
medications and her respiratory status continued to improve. She 
was initially continued on supplemental oxygen and was then 
transitioned to room air with normal O2 saturations. She 
ambulated on her own and her pain continued to be 
well-controlled with oral pain medications. She remained 
afebrile with normal vital signs. Her foley catheter was 
removed, and she had adequate urine output through voids as well 
as through her nephrostomy tube. She received a full course of 
antibiotics (IV azithromycin for 5 days) for her pneumonia and 
received ceftriaxone for her urosepsis. On the day of discharge, 
she was transitioned to oral cefpodoxime for a planned total 14 
day course. Fetal status was monitored twice daily with 
non-stress tests, which were reassuring. By hospital day 8, her 
pain was well controlled with oral medication, and she was 
discharged home in stable condition with outpatient follow-up as 
scheduled.

obstructing right ureteral stone, and recent admission for
urosepsis from ___ due to recurrent pyelonephritis
requiring an admission to the FICU due to hypoxemic respiratory
failure requiring intubation, presenting today for right flank
pain.   

She reported that the pain began on ___ and has been
increasingly worsening  until this evening when her typical pain
medications of Dilaudid were no longer treating her pain.  She
denies any fevers.  She endorses active fetal movement and 
denies
any vaginal bleeding or loss of fluid.  She is having
intermittent contractions that occur approximately every 10
minutes.  

Patient presented to triage on ___ with a similar
presentation to today's. Labs were done were notable for a
leukocytosis of 11.6, urine culture was growing prelim gram
negative rods she was restarted on cefpodoxime and told to
discontinue macrobid. However, the patient has yet to pick up 
the
prescription.  She was evaluated by urology during this visit.

no concerns.  

In brief her prior h/s is significant for a diagnosis of
pyelonephritis secondary to E. coli/staph epidermidis in ___.  She had a CT scan showing a 5 mm stone and renal
ultrasound unremarkable for hydronephrosis.  She had ureteral
stents placed on ___ and removed on ___.  She was on
Keflex for suppression but stopped this medication 2 weeks prior
to her admission for urosepsis.  On admission she was noted to 
be
febrile, tachycardic, and tachypneic.  Fetal heart rate was

ultrasound that showed severe right hydroureteronephrosis she
underwent a placement of a right percutaneous nephrostomy tube 
on
___.  During this admission she developed increased
tachypnea and rapidly worsening respiratory distress.  She was
intubated and transferred to the ICU for acute hypoxemic
respiratory failure.  She had a CTA negative for pulmonary
embolism.  This episode was thought to be secondary to ARDS due
to pyelonephritis in the pregnancy.  There was also concern for
acute pulmonary edema secondary to fluid overload since the
patient improved with a dose of IV Lasix.  She was treated with
vancomycin and Zosyn and then narrowed to ceftriaxone and
aggressively resuscitated in the ICU. She was treated for
pneumonia with IV azithromycin for 5 days. She was discharged

Followup Instructions:
___
","Certainly! Here are the reasons for the ICD-10 codes based on the medical record:

**I21.4: Non-ST elevation (NSTEMI) myocardial infarction**
- Reason: The patient presented with chest pressure and was found to have an NSTEMI with dynamic EKG changes, elevated troponin levels (troponin 0.37 > 1.4 and MB elevation), and was managed with nitro gtt, heparin gtt, and aspirin.

**I25.10: Atherosclerotic heart disease of native coronary artery without angina pectoris**
- Reason: The patient has a known history of coronary artery disease (CAD) with multiple previous interventions (CABG, DES, and PCI). The current presentation did not include typical angina symptoms, as the chest discomfort was described as a ""pressure"" and ""ache.""

**I10: Essential (primary) hypertension**
- Reason: The patient has a documented history of hypertension, and his blood pressure was managed during the hospital stay. His home medication included valsartan, which was later switched to losartan due to a recall.

**E78.00: Pure hypercholesterolemia, unspecified**
- Reason: The patient has a documented history of hypercholesteremia. His home medication included pravastatin, which was switched to atorvastatin during the hospital stay to optimize lipid control.

**E11.9: Type 2 diabetes mellitus without complications**
- Reason: The patient has a known history of diabetes, and his home medication included metformin. During the hospital stay, metformin was held, and he was initiated on insulin sliding scale to manage his blood glucose levels.

**Z87.891: Personal history of nicotine dependence**
- Reason: While not explicitly mentioned in the current medical record, this code is often used if there is a documented history of smoking, which is common in patients with cardiovascular disease. However, the specific evidence for this code is not provided in the given text.

**Z82.49: Family history of ischemic heart disease and other diseases of the circulatory system**
- Reason: The patient""s father had a myocardial infarction (MI), indicating a family history of ischemic heart disease.

Followup Instructions:
___
","D252: Subserosal leiomyoma of uterus
- Reason: The patient underwent a robotic-assisted laparoscopic myomectomy converted to mini laparotomy for symptomatic fibroids. This indicates the presence of uterine fibroids, which can be subserosal, intramural, or submucosal. While the specific type of fibroid is not explicitly mentioned, the coding of subserosal leiomyoma is appropriate if it was one of the types found.

D680: Von Willebrand disease
- Reason: The patient is mentioned to have a known condition, but the specific condition is not fully named in the medical record. However, the code D680 is provided, suggesting that the patient has Von Willebrand disease. This is a plausible condition given the context of the surgery and the need for tranexamic acid (TXA) for bleeding control.

D251: Intramural leiomyoma of uterus
- Reason: Similar to the reasoning for D252, the patient underwent a myomectomy for symptomatic fibroids. Intramural leiomyomas are common and can cause significant symptoms, making this code appropriate if intramural fibroids were among those treated.

N838: Other noninflammatory disorders of ovary, fallopian tube, and broad ligament
- Reason: The patient also had a left paratubal cystectomy performed during the same procedure. Paratubal cysts are noninflammatory disorders of the fallopian tube area, fitting this code.

Z5331: Laparoscopic surgical procedure converted to open procedure
- Reason: The medical record explicitly states that the robotic-assisted laparoscopic myomectomy was converted to a mini laparotomy. This code accurately reflects the procedural conversion that occurred.","You are a coder who is proficient in ICD10. Now, please analyze and give reasons for the coding based on the medical record text and ICD10 coding results.

Followup Instructions:
___
","Certainly! Here are the reasons for the provided ICD-10 codes based on the evidence in the original medical record:

**S82231A: Displaced oblique fracture of shaft of right tibia, initial encounter for closed fracture**
- **Reason**: The patient was found to have a closed right tibia/fibula fracture, and she underwent intramedullary nailing of the right femur. The term ""displaced oblique fracture"" is inferred from the nature of the injury and the surgical procedure performed.

**S82451A: Displaced comminuted fracture of shaft of right fibula, initial encounter for closed fracture**
- **Reason**: The patient was found to have a closed right tibia/fibula fracture. The term ""comminuted"" is often used to describe fractures where the bone is broken into multiple pieces, which is a common finding in severe trauma.

**W19XXXA: Unspecified fall, initial encounter**
- **Reason**: The patient was found on the floor after a fall, as reported by her daughter. The fall led to the right tibia/fibula fracture.

**Y92009: Unspecified place in unspecified non-institutional (private) residence as the place of occurrence of the external cause**
- **Reason**: The fall occurred at home, as indicated by the daughter""s account of finding the patient on the floor when she returned to the room.

**D649: Anemia, unspecified**
- **Reason**: The patient has a history of anemia, and the blood test results show low hemoglobin (Hgb-8.9) and hematocrit (Hct-28.3).

**I10: Essential (primary) hypertension**
- **Reason**: The patient has a history of hypertension (HTN).

**F329: Major depressive disorder, single episode, unspecified**
- **Reason**: The patient has a history of depression.

**M810: Age-related osteoporosis without current pathological fracture**
- **Reason**: The patient has a history of osteoporosis, which increases the risk of fractures.

**R55: Syncope and collapse**
- **Reason**: The patient has a history of syncope, and the fall might have been related to a syncopal episode.

**E162: Hypoglycemia, unspecified**
- **Reason**: The code E162 is not supported by the medical record. There is no mention of hypoglycemia in the patient""s history or current condition.

**R0902: Hypoxemia**
- **Reason**: The code R0902 is not supported by the medical record. There is no mention of hypoxemia in the patient""s history or current condition.

**I9581: Postprocedural hypotension**
- **Reason**: The code I9581 is not supported by the medical record. There is no mention of postprocedural hypotension in the patient""s history or current condition.

These codes are justified based on the information provided in the medical record, ensuring that each code is directly supported by the clinical documentation.","You are a coder who is proficient in ICD10.

Daughter states she was in her OSH until 3 days prior to
admission when she c/o feeling ""hot"" and flushed.  She denied 
any
fevers/chills, urinary symptoms, cough, SOB, or abdominal pain. 
Recently was discharged from ___ and had good PO
intake at home.  Daughter states she was recently given
glucometer to test her mother's BG but was unable to get test
strips as these were not covered by her insurance.

At 3AM the morning of presentation, ___ states that she heard a
thud from her mother's room, and found her on the floor in a
puddle of water.  Her mother's mental status was ""off"" and she
was c/o some R shoulder pain.  As her MS did not clear for
several hours, EMS was called.  When EMS arrived, they found 
that
she was confused with FSBG of 56.  She received glucose with
return to baseline MS.

___ note, pt was found to be quite hypoglycemic to the 20___-30___
during her last hospitalization.  Seen by the Med Consult team
who felt that her hypoglycemia was likely due to poor PO intake
and decreased gluconeogenesis.  Metoprolol was held for
hypotension and hypoglycemia.  Both issues had resolved on
discharge.

On arrival to the ED, pt afebrile and VSS.
Her FSBG was initially 94 on arrival but then decreased to 36
over 2 hours.  D50 was administered again with improvement of

who said family friend
at ___ who is an Endocrinologist felt hypoglycemia may be 
due to prior gastric resection for PUD.  On review of 
literature, there appears to be a condition called noninsulinoma 
pancreatogenous hypoglycemia syndrome which sometimes occurs 
after gastric surgery (d/t beta cell hypertrophy) but is 
apparently rarer than insulinoma.  
Endocrinology was consulted. The differential for her 
hypoglycemia included endogenous vs. exogenous insulin-driven 
process, insufficient substrate (starvation, liver disease), 
accelerated utilization (tumor, sepsis), adrenal insufficiency 
(essentially ruled out by am cortisol of 24). Other 
considerations in the setting of her prior gastric surgery and 
described hot flushes include dumping syndrome and 
neuroendocrine tumor.
She had a 72 hour fast, and her CBG did not drop below 50 for 
the entire fast. Thus, most likely she does not have an 
insulinoma or other insulin-hypersecretion state. Given the 
history of episodic hypoglycemia after boluses of 
carbohydrate-heavy foods (like ___ sweets), her presentation 
was most consistent with reactive
hypoglycemia. Nutrition was consulted to educate the patient and 
her daughter re: dietary strategies to treat reactive 
hypoglycemia - small frequent meals throughout the day, mixed 
meals (avoiding carb loads), avoiding foods with high glycemic 
index. The full panel of hypoglycemic labs are still pending. 
There is no need to check blood sugars routinely unless she has 
symptoms suggestive of hypoglycemia.  Even if BG is low, 
drinking juice would cause a rapid rise which would then result 
in a rebound decrease.  A1C done in ___ was normal, so no 
need for Metformin.  

# Citrobacter UTI
Pt denied urinary complaints initially. She had >100K CFUs of 
Citrobacter amalonaticus growing in urine culture. She has a 
history of pan-sensitive E.coli UTI in ___. Despite lack of 
symptoms will treat given her recent possible syncope/fall, 
which could be due to hypoglycemia but there may be some 
component from
infection. She was initially treated with ceftriaxone, however 
sensitivities
showed that Citrobacter was resistant to CTX so she was switched 
to nitrofurantoin to complete a 5 day course. 

# Fall from Standing
# Possible Syncope
Pt found down near her bed after having presumed syncopal event. 
 Most likely trigger was hypoglycemic episode.  However, pt with 
long history of syncopal events with prodromal symptoms that 
sound very vasovagal in nature. UTI may be contributing (in ___ 
she had a fall/syncopal episode and was found to have an E.coli
UTI). Telemetry for >48 hours has been unremarkable. 
Orthostatics vital signs were normal. ___ was consulted and 
recommended rehab.

# R Clavicle Fracture
Pt with minimally displaced clavicular fracture found on x-ray. 
This was discussed with orthopedics. She should follow up in 
their clinic ___ weeks after discharge. They recommended that 
she keep the RUE in sling for comfort only - otherwise she is 
able to participate in any & all weight-bearing activities as 
tolerated. Her pain was consulted with Tylenol, tramadol prn 
pain.  

Chronic Problems:
# Osteoporosis: continued home calcium, calcitriol, vitamins. 
She may benefit from a DEXA scan as an outpatient, but her PCP 
can discuss this with her and her family.

Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted to the hospital with low blood sugar 
(hypoglycemia).  This was a reaction to your body responding 
strongly to carbohydrates and sugars and having a rebound low 
blood sugar as a result.  This can be prevented by having low 
carb, frequent meals. 

We wish you the best in your recovery,
Your ___ team 
 
Followup Instructions:
___
","E161: Other hypoglycemia
- Reason: The patient presented with recurrent hypoglycemia, which was confirmed by multiple blood glucose measurements during the hospital stay. The hypoglycemia was attributed to reactive hypoglycemia, a condition where the body overreacts to carbohydrate intake, leading to a drop in blood sugar levels.

N390: Urinary tract infection, site not specified
- Reason: The patient had a urine culture that grew Citrobacter amalonaticus, indicating a urinary tract infection (UTI). Although she denied urinary symptoms initially, treatment was initiated due to the recent fall and possible contribution of the infection to her symptoms.

E440: Moderate protein-calorie malnutrition
- Reason: The patient has a history of pernicious anemia and malnutrition, and her labs showed low MCH and MCHC, which can indicate malnutrition. Additionally, her BMI is noted to be 19.9 or less, which is considered underweight.

F0390: Unspecified dementia, unspecified severity, without behavioral disturbance, psychotic disturbance, mood disturbance, and anxiety
- Reason: The patient has a documented history of dementia, and her mental status is described as being ""off"" and confused at times. The history also mentions significant dementia at baseline.

Z681: Body mass index [BMI] 19.9 or less, adult
- Reason: The patient""s BMI is noted to be 19.9 or less, which falls into the underweight category.

E785: Hyperlipidemia, unspecified
- Reason: The patient is on pantoprazole, a medication often prescribed for hyperlipidemia, and her social history suggests a risk for cardiovascular issues. However, this code may be less directly supported by the medical record and might be more inferential.

M810: Age-related osteoporosis without current pathological fracture
- Reason: The patient has a documented history of osteoporosis, and although she did not sustain a pathological fracture during this admission, her history supports the diagnosis.

S42031A: Displaced fracture of lateral end of right clavicle, initial encounter for closed fracture
- Reason: The patient was diagnosed with a displaced fracture of the lateral end of the right clavicle, as evidenced by imaging studies. This is an initial encounter for the treatment of this fracture.

W19XXXA: Unspecified fall, initial encounter
- Reason: The patient was admitted following a fall, which led to the discovery of hypoglycemia and the right clavicle fracture. This code captures the external cause of the injury.

Y92003: Bedroom of unspecified non-institutional (private) residence as the place of occurrence of the external cause
- Reason: The fall occurred in the patient""s bedroom, as reported by her daughter.

B9689: Other specified bacterial agents as the cause of diseases classified elsewhere
- Reason: The urine culture grew Citrobacter amalonaticus, which is a specific bacterial agent causing the urinary tract infection.

R55: Syncope and collapse
- Reason: The patient has a history of recurrent syncope, and the fall was likely triggered by a hypoglycemic episode, which can cause syncope.

I10: Essential (primary) hypertension
- Reason: The patient has a documented history of hypertension, and this is a chronic condition that is part of her past medical history.

H409: Unspecified glaucoma
- Reason: The patient is on multiple medications for glaucoma, including brimonidine, dorzolamide/timolol, and latanoprost, indicating a diagnosis of glaucoma. However, the specific type of glaucoma is not specified in the medical record.","You are a coder who is proficient in ICD10. Now, please analyze and give reasons for the coding based on the medical record text and ICD10 coding results.

History of Present Illness:
___ yr old man with HTN and HLD who presents with ___ months of 
R-sided chest, shoulder, and neck pain after eating and physical 
activity.  The patient noted in ___ of last year he would 
experience predominantly R-sided chest pain accompanied by R 
shoulder and, occasionally, R neck pain after physical activity 
and after eating.  This pain is relieved with rest, resolving 
after ___ after cessation of the inciting activity.  He was 
evaluated by his PCP in ___ but due to the atypical 
presentation and his current work up for GERD (diagnosed with a 
hiatal hernia approximately 1 mo ago), further evaluation was 
not pursued until he saw his PCP in ___ approximately one 
week ago.  He does report his GERD-like symptoms are different 
from his R-sided chest pain following exertion.  Since his first 
evaluation in ___, his chest pain episodes have been 
increasing in frequency, although not in severity.  Since his 
symptoms had persisted he was sent for Stress ECHO on ___ 
for evaluation.  During these episodes, he denies any concerning 
symptoms such as SOB, palpitations, dizziness, nausea/vomiting, 
or diaphoresis.  He does endorse DOE after climbing stairs but 
notes no appreciable ___ edema.  Of note, he does report having a 
Stress ECHO last year after an anxiety/panic-like episode during 
which he had a fast heart rate.

On ___, his Stress test showed the following:
 His EKG at baseline was sinus rhythm at 98 beats per minute 
with  
 ___epressions in the inferolateral leads. He assured 
us  
 that these were known abnormalities. He had no chest pain to  
 start the test. During exercise at about 3 minutes of exercise, 
 
 he developed right arm to upper chest discomfort, this 
increased  
 to ___ in severity during exercise. His EKG while generally  
 uninterpretable at baseline had changes of an additional 2 mm 
of  
 flat to downsloping ST depressions in the inferolateral leads 
and  
 additional 1-2 mm of elevation in AVR. He completed 7 minutes 
of  
 the protocol. He stopped secondary to overall leg fatigue. His  

 echocardiographic images showed normal functional pre and  
 post-exercise.  
 After the test, he continued to have these persistent ST  
 depressions and his jaw and shoulder pain while lessened had 
not  
 disappeared. He received two nitroglycerin sublingually and at  

 25 minutes post-exercise, he had ___ discomfort in his jaw and 
 
 his EKG was almost back to baseline.  In this setting, his 
Troponin was <0.01

Given these results and his history of present illness, he was 
referred to ___ for immediate cardiac catheterization.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___,

It was a pleasure taking care of you at the ___ 
___. 

You underwent cardiac catheterization on ___ which revealed 
coronary artery disease. You did not have any stents placed 
because it was thought your disease would be best treated with 
surgery. You were seen by our cardiac surgery team in 
preparation for coronary heart surgery.

It is very important to take all of your heart healthy 
medications. 

You are now on aspirin. You need to take aspirin everyday. Do 
not stop taking aspirin unless you are told by your 
cardiologist. You also need to continue taking Atorvastatin, 
Losartan, and Metoprolol.

We wish you all the best, 

Your ___ Cardiology team
  
 
Followup Instructions:
___
","Certainly! Here are the reasons for the ICD-10 codes based on the provided medical record:

I25119: Atherosclerotic heart disease of native coronary artery with unspecified angina pectoris
- **Reason**: The patient has a history of chest pain with exercise and a confirmed 3-vessel disease (3VD) on cardiac catheterization. The chest pain is described as stable angina, which is relieved with rest. This indicates atherosclerotic heart disease with angina pectoris.

H9113: Presbycusis, bilateral
- **Reason**: The patient has a documented history of bilateral hearing loss due to presbycusis.

G4733: Obstructive sleep apnea (adult) (pediatric)
- **Reason**: The patient has a documented history of sleep apnea.

K219: Gastro-esophageal reflux disease without esophagitis
- **Reason**: The patient has a documented history of GERD, and he was recently diagnosed with a hiatal hernia, which is related to GERD.

K449: Diaphragmatic hernia without obstruction or gangrene
- **Reason**: The patient has a documented history of a hiatal hernia, which is a type of diaphragmatic hernia.

N400: Benign prostatic hyperplasia without lower urinary tract symptoms
- **Reason**: The patient has a documented history of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and is on tamsulosin.

presents to the emergency department with abdominal distention. 
 
He was seen today by Dr. ___ in ___ clinic with
worsening abdominal distention. Per the hepatology outpatient
note: ""He has been stable in term of fluid overload over past
year and he has been evaluated for umbilical hernia repair. He
underwent cardiac evaluation with echocardiogram showing severe
AS but still was cleared for surgery due to lack of symptoms.""

for
which he is on ferrous gluconate. 

On evaluation on the floor, the patient states that he still has
diffuse abdominal pain.  He states that, 2 months ago, he 
weighed
234 pounds.  On arrival to the floor, he weighs 238 pounds.  He

SUMMARY STATEMENT: 
==================
___ with h/o T2DM, cryptogenic cirrhosis c/b non-occlusive PVT,
esophageal varices (___) s/p banding, and portal 
hypertension,
who was admitted for abdominal distention. 

ACUTE ISSUES: 
=============
#Decompensated cirrhosis
Upon admission, MELD-Na 15, Child class B. The patient presented 
with 1 month of
worsening abdominal distention, and 3 days of worsening 
abdominal pain. He had no asterixis and no history of hepatic 
encephalopathy. Of note, the patient weighed 245 pounds at an 
outpatient visit in ___. On this admission, he weighed 238 
pounds. Ascites fluid studies were negative for SBP. The patient 
did receive 2 g of ceftriaxone in the ED for initial concern of 
SBP. His hernia was reducible on physical exam, so this was 
likely not contributing to his pain. His lactate was slightly 
elevated at 2.9 on admission, but downtrended to 1.0 on repeat 
labs. His abdominal pain was deemed likely secondary to 
worsening of his ascites from his decompensated cirrhosis, and 
he underwent ___ guided therapeutic paracentesis with 4.25L 
removed on ___, which was followed by 8g/kg albumin repletion. 
Additionally he was actively diuresed with IV lasix 20mg on ___ 
and spironolactone 200mg. He was started on midodrine 5mg TID on 
___ for low SBPs ___. He was discharged with lasix 20mg 
and spironolactone 150mg. His discharge weight was: 103.06 kg 
(227.2 lb). His Cr on discharge was 1.2. 

#Pancytopenia
#Coagulopathy
#Iron deficiency anemia
Patient presented with a hemoglobin of 11.9, macrocytosis, white 
count of 3, platelets of 68, INR 1.5. This is all likely 
secondary to his liver disease. There were no active signs of 
bleeding and his hemoglobin stayed stable during hospital stay. 
Discharge hemoglobin 11.3.

#Asymptomatic bacteriuria
The patient's UA is notable for positive nitrites, positive leuk 
esterases, positive bacteria. The patient denied any urinary 
symptoms. He had no CVA tenderness on exam. He did receive 2 g 
of ceftriaxone in the ED. Urine cultures were pending on 
discharge. 

CHRONIC ISSUES: 
===============
#T2DM
Patient with a history of type 2 diabetes, but his most recent 
outpatient hemoglobin A1c was 5.1. This suggests that his 
diabetes was over-treated with the 24 units of glargine that he 
was taking. Patient's glargine was heled on admission and he was 
kept on Humalog ISS. His FSBS ranged from 114 to maximum 166 and 
only required a one time 2u Humalog while admitted. His home 
glargine was held on discharge and he was instructed to record 
FSBS at home. 

#Esophageal varices status post banding
The patient had esophageal varices and banding in ___. There 
was no active evidence of bleeding. He denied melena and guaiac 
was negative on admission. He has been unable to tolerate 
beta-blockers in the past for bleeding prophylaxis.

#Gout
Continued on home allopurinol

#Chronic Bilateral leg cramping for which he is prescribed 5 mg 
oxycodone as needed by his PCP, which was verified and continued 
during hospital stay. 

#GERD
Continued home pantoprazole

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
=====================
Discharge weight: 103.06 kg (227.2 lb) 
Discharge hemoglobin: 11.3
Discharge MELD-Na score: 19

[] Diuretic regimen on discharge: 20mg lasix, 150mg 
spironolactone. Please follow up BMP, weight and volume status

normal global/regional systolic function. Severe aortic 
stenosis. Mildly dilated thoracic aorta. Mild to moderate aortic 
regurgitation.

___ TAVR AND TORSO CTA 
FINDINGS:  
EXTRACARDIAC FINDINGS: 
CT CHEST WITH CONTRAST: Visualized thyroid gland is 
unremarkable.  There is no supraclavicular, axillary, 
mediastinal, or hilar lymphadenopathy.  Heart is normal in size. 
 There is no pericardial effusion.  There are mild-to-moderate 
coronary artery calcifications.  As discussed below, the aortic 
valve is tricuspid and heavily calcified with thickening of the 
leaflets.  No suggestion of left atrial thrombus.  There is no 
pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  There is bibasilar 
atelectasis without concerning parenchymal consolidation or 
nodularity.  Airways are patent to the subsegmental level.  
There is no centrally located pulmonary embolus.  Pulmonary 
vasculature is enlarged, with main, left, and right pulmonary 
arteries measuring 3.1, 3.0, and 2.8 cm, respectively.  These 
findings are suggestive of sequela of pulmonary arterial 
hypertension.  Soft tissues demonstrate symmetric gynecomastia, 
expected in this patient with known cirrhosis.  Additionally, 
there are significant paraesophageal varices, which are 
partially visualized in the lower chest, in the region of the 
esophageal hiatus.   
CT ABDOMEN/PELVIS WITH CONTRAST: Please see dictation from 
concurrent CTA 
abdomen and pelvis for full description of subdiaphragmatic 
findings and 
osseous structures in this region.  
OSSEOUS STRUCTURES: There are no concerning sclerotic or lytic 
lesions in the thoracic spine or thoracic cage.  No acute 
compression deformity or acute fracture of the major structures 
of the bony thorax.  
CTA: Due to severe liver cirrhosis, there is poor arterial 
timing, which limits the cardiac CTA portion of this exam.  
Overall, cardiac portion of this exam is nondiagnostic. 
CARDIAC: Heart is normal in size.  Mild-to-moderate coronary 
artery 
calcifications are present.  Aortic valve is tricuspid and 
heavily calcified with thickened leaflets.  No suggestion of 
left atrial thrombus on this limited exam.  Pericardium is 
normal without pericardial effusion. 
PULMONARY ARTERIES: Pulmonary vasculature is enlarged, as above. 
Findings 
likely represent sequela of pulmonary arterial hypertension. 
AORTA:  The thoracic and abdominal aorta are normal in size with 
mild 
calcifications. 
MEASUREMENTS: To follow an addendum pending 3D reformats. 
IMPRESSION: 
1. Aortic valve stenosis without evidence of aortic aneurysm. 
Cardiac portion of the examination is limited due to poor 
arterial contrast timing due to severe liver cirrhosis.  If 
necessary for preprocedural planning, this portion of the exam 
can be repeated. 
2. Measurements of subclavian and femoral arteries to follow in 
an addendum pending 3D reformats. 
3. Gynecomastia and paraesophageal varices, consistent with 
sequela of known cirrhosis.

Brief Hospital Course:
SUMMARY:
=======================================================
Mr. ___ is a ___ year old man with history of cryptogenic 
cirrhosis (Child ___ B, MELD 15 on admission) decompensated by 
varices s/p banding (___) and progressive non-occlusive portal 
vein/SMV thrombosis, who presented for evaluation for 
thrombecty/TIPS given worsening thrombosis. It was determined 
that TIPS would be the optimal procedure for his thrombosis, but 
would not be done unless he was a liver transplant candidate. 
Furthermore, he has severe AS and it was felt that he required 
AVR prior to any other procedures given his high risk. He 
partially completed evaluation for TAVR and liver 
transplantation while he was admitted, with plan to complete the 
evaluation as an outpatient given his clinical stability. 

ACUTE ISSUES:
=======================================================
#Portal vein thrombosis
#SMV thrombosis 
Patient has a history of nonocclusive portal vein/SMV 
thrombosis, first noted on imaging in ___. Between ___ and 
___, he had progression of fibrosis including portal 
and superior mesenteric veins. He was admitted for consideration 
of thrombectomy versus TIPS by ___. The ___ team felt that 
thrombectomy would be unlikely to provide benefit and thus 
recommended TIPS procedure. However, as noted below, the patient 
was found to have severe aortic stenosis so the TIPS was 
deferred until repair of his aortic valve. 

#Severe aortic stenosis
Last TTE in ___ demonstrated moderate to severe aortic 
valve stenosis. On admission the patient endorsed 
lightheadedness and dyspnea on exertion limiting his daily 
function, thought to be secondary to his AS. Repeat TTE during 
this admission found progressive ALS with valve area 1.1 cm2. 
Cardiology and structural heart teams were consulted and felt 
that he was a good TAVR candidate. He was evaluated by cardiac 
surgery and found to be not a surgical AVR candidate. He also 
underwent TAVR CT and left heart cath for planning purposes. His 
coronary angiography was overall normal with only 30% stenosis 
at the proximal left circumflex and no other clinically 
significant disease. Per the cardiology structural team they 
will plan on reviewing his CT chest again and consider repeating 
it if necessary. They will arrange his TAVR as an outpatient. 

#Acute on chronic kidney injury
On admission the patient's creatinine was 1.3 with a baseline of 
1.0-1.2 up to ___, after which time his creatinine remains 
elevated (1.3-1.5). Etiology was unclear but was felt to be 
secondary to hypovolemia in the setting of cirrhosis and 
diuresis. His diuretics were held on admission without 
improvement in his creatinine. He was also noted to be 
hypotensive with systolic blood pressures ___ on hospital day 2. 
He was started on midodrine and received albumin with 
improvement of his Cr back to baseline. 

#Hypotension
On admission the patient was made n.p.o. for possible endoscopy. 
Overnight he became hypotensive to the ___ (baseline 
systolic 80-100). He was given IV fluids and albumin with 
subsequent improvement. As above, during admission his diuretics 
were held and he was given small boluses of albumin to maintain 
euvolemia due to his tenuous volume status secondary to 
cirrhosis and aortic stenosis. He had no further episodes of 
hypotension.

#Cryptogenic cirrhosis (Childs B, MELD 15)
Hx of decompensation by variceal bleed in ___ s/p banding and 
ascites. As above his home Lasix and spironolactone were held. 
He was maintained on a low sodium diet. He was continued on 
lactulose 30 ml TID and rifaximin. He is potentially a 
transplant candidate, test workup was initiated in the hospital 
including infectious serologies, malignancy screening, lipid 
panel, PSA, Panorex, PFTs, EGD/Colonoscopy and TTE.

CHRONIC ISSUES:
=======================================================

#T2DM
Home Glargine was discontinued on last admission due to recent 
outpatient A1c of 5.1%. Thus the patient was managed on a 
Humalog sliding scale only. 

#Gout
Continued home allopurinol.

#GERD
Continued home pantoprazole.

#Iron deficiency anemia
Continued home ferrous sulfate.

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
=======================================================
[] Patient is a potential liver transplant candidate. Work-up 
was started in-house but needs to be completed as an outpatient 
prior to listing. 
[] Patient should be provided with panorex results for follow up 
with his outpt dentist 
[] His lactulose was increased from 15ml BID to 30ml TID as he 
was intermittently somnolent, and concern for HE at home.
[] patient restarted on his home diuretics, will need repeat 
labs (BMP) in 1 week 
[] patient with 30% stenosis of left circ but otherwise no CAD 
on cath from ___

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___,

You were admitted to the hospital because you had a clot in your 
veins around the liver. 

WHAT HAPPENED WHILE YOU WERE IN THE HOSPITAL?
- You had imaging of the heart which showed a problem with the 
aortic valve.
- You were evaluated by several different teams (Interventional 
Radiology, Cardiology, Cardiac Surgery) to look at the issue 
with blood clots and your heart. It was determined that you need 
an aortic valve replacement before anything more can be done 
about the blood clots. 
- You improved and were ready to leave the hospital.
- You had a procedure called a cardiac cath which did not show 
any significant coronary artery disease 

WHAT DO YOU NEED TO DO WHEN YOU LEAVE THE HOSPITAL?
- Take all of your medications as prescribed (listed below)
- Keep your follow up appointments with your doctors
- Weigh yourself every morning, before you eat or take your 
medications. Call your doctor if your weight changes by more 
than 3 pounds
- Please stick to a low salt diet and monitor your fluid intake
- If you experience any of the danger signs listed below please 
call your primary care doctor or come to the emergency 
department immediately.

It was a pleasure participating in your care. We wish you the 
best!
- Your ___ Care Team

 
Followup Instructions:
___
","Certainly! Here are the reasons for the ICD-10 codes based on the evidence from the medical record:

**I81: Portal vein thrombosis**
- **Reason:** The patient has a history of nonocclusive portal vein thrombosis, which was first noted on imaging and progressed over time. The patient was admitted for consideration of thrombectomy or TIPS due to worsening thrombosis.

**I5033: Acute on chronic diastolic (congestive) heart failure**
- **Reason:** This code does not seem to be directly supported by the medical record. The patient has severe aortic stenosis and hypotension but no specific mention of diastolic heart failure.

**I82890: Acute embolism and thrombosis of other specified veins**
- **Reason:** The patient has a history of nonocclusive superior mesenteric vein (SMV) thrombosis, which is a specified vein. This code is appropriate for the thrombosis of the SMV.

DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS  
======================  
 
Dear Mr. ___,  
It was a pleasure caring for you at ___ 
___.  

WHY WAS I IN THE HOSPITAL?  
- You came to the hospital because you had an episode of melena. 


WHAT HAPPENED TO ME IN THE HOSPITAL?  
- We looked in your intestines to check for any signs of active 
bleeding. The procedure (push enteroscopy) was unable to be 
completed unfortunately, however your blood level remained 
stable. Please follow up with your gastroenterologist regarding 
any need for further diagnostic studies
- We also treated you for bacteria in your urine.
- You reported some chest pain to us, and we got EKGs to check 
your heart's electrical activity. We saw an abnormality called a 
left bundle branch block, which can occur after a procedure like 
the one you received last month (TAVR). We were reassured 
against any urgent issue, so we encourage you to follow up with 
your cardiologist Dr. ___ this.

WHAT SHOULD I DO AFTER I LEAVE THE HOSPITAL?  
- Continue to take all your medicines and keep your 
appointments.  
We wish you the best!  

 Sincerely,  
 Your ___ Team  
 
Followup Instructions:
___
","K921: Melena
- Reason: The patient presented with melena, which is explicitly mentioned in the chief complaint and throughout the hospital course. The labs show a stable hemoglobin level, and the patient was treated with pantoprazole and octreotide for the melena.

I81: Portal vein thrombosis
- Reason: The patient has a documented history of non-occlusive portal vein thrombosis, and the CT abdomen/pelvis confirmed the presence of nonocclusive thrombus in the portal veins, portal splenic confluence, and superior mesenteric vein (SMV).

K7469: Other cirrhosis of liver
- Reason: The patient has a history of cryptogenic cirrhosis, which is mentioned multiple times in the medical record, including the past medical history and the clinical implications section. The CT abdomen/pelvis also shows cirrhosis with sequelae of portal hypertension.

R079: Chest pain, unspecified
- Reason: The patient reported intermittent chest pain, and an EKG showed a new left bundle branch block (LBBB). Although troponins were negative and there was no evidence of acute coronary syndrome, the chest pain is still a significant issue that was evaluated during the hospital stay.

I350: Nonrheumatic aortic (valve) stenosis
- Reason: The patient has a history of severe aortic valve stenosis and underwent a transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR). The TTE during the hospital stay confirmed a well-seated, normal functioning TAVR with mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy and normal biventricular function.

N189: Chronic kidney disease, unspecified
- Reason: The patient has one functional kidney and a creatinine level at the upper limit of baseline, indicating chronic kidney disease (CKD). This is also mentioned in the chronic/stable issues section.

M109: Gout, unspecified
- Reason: The patient has a history of gout and is on allopurinol for management. This is noted in the past medical history and the discharge medications.

K219: Gastro-esophageal reflux disease without esophagitis
- Reason: The patient is on pantoprazole, a proton pump inhibitor (PPI), for the management of gastro-esophageal reflux disease (GERD). This is mentioned in the discharge medications and the chronic/stable issues section.

D509: Iron deficiency anemia, unspecified
- Reason: The patient has a documented history of iron deficiency anemia, and the iron supplementation (ferrous gluconate) was held initially and then restarted upon discharge. This is noted in the past medical history and the discharge medications.
