History of Present Illness:
___ male with ___ disease, dyslipidemia, and a
history of prostate cancer (s/p prostatectomy) who was referred
to the ED by his neurologist for worsening gait, falls, and
visual hallucinations. 

The following history is taken from chart review: 

The patient was seen by his neurologist on ___ at which time he
was noted to have visual hallucinations and worsening gait
freezing. For his gait freezing, his mirapex was increased by
0.125 mg every week to a goal dose of 0.75 mg t.i.d. He
successfully up-titrated the medicine to 0.75/0.625/0.625 but
began to have visual hallucinations and confusion so on ___ his
neurologist recommended decreasing the dose to 0.625 TID. 
Despite
the changes to his Mirapex, the patient's daughter has noted
progressive gait stiffness and increased difficulty standing.
This has resulted in difficulty with simply getting to the
bathroom leading to episodes of incontinence. A UA performed on
___ was reassuring. 

On the day of presentation to the hospital, the patient began to
experience visual hallucinations of a motor cross race in his
backyard. He subsequently had a fall while transferring from the
couch to a chair. His wife was unable to get him off the floor.
The fall was witnessed and there was no head strike. Per the
patient's wife, his gait has acutely worsened over the past 24
hours to the point where he has been unable to ambulate on his
own. The patient's daughter called his neurologist who
recommended presentation to the ED. 

In the ED, the patient was afebrile, HRs ___, normotensive, and
SpO2 100% RA. On exam he was noted to have cogwheeling of upper
extremities and decrease ___ strength. Labs were remarkable for a
negative urine and serum tox, Na 132, K 5.8 (hemolyzed and no 
EKG
changes), negative troponin, normal LFTs, unremarkable CBC. 
Chest
Xray showed no acute process and CTH was reassuring. He was
evaluated by neurology who recommended admission to medicine for
failure to thrive, to continue the patient's home medications,
and complete a toxo-metabolic workup. The patient was given his
home pramipexole and pravastatin before he was admitted.  

On arrival to the floor, the patient is comfortable in bed. He 
is
not accompanied by family on my interview. He knows that he is 
in
the hospital and that it is ___. He is not sure why he is here
and begins to tell me about a party in his house with a motor
cross race in his backyard. When I asked him about his fall, he
mentions that he has not had a fall for ___ years. He denies any
fevers, chills, cough, chest pain, abdominal pain, nausea,
diarrhea, or dysuria.
