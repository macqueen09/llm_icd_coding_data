History of Present Illness:
___ male with ___ disease, dyslipidemia, and a
history of prostate cancer (s/p prostatectomy) who was referred
to the ED by his neurologist for worsening gait, falls, and
visual hallucinations. 

The following history is taken from chart review: 

The patient was seen by his neurologist on ___ at which time he
was noted to have visual hallucinations and worsening gait
freezing. For his gait freezing, his mirapex was increased by
0.125 mg every week to a goal dose of 0.75 mg t.i.d. He
successfully up-titrated the medicine to 0.75/0.625/0.625 but
began to have visual hallucinations and confusion so on ___ his
neurologist recommended decreasing the dose to 0.625 TID. 
Despite
the changes to his Mirapex, the patient's daughter has noted
progressive gait stiffness and increased difficulty standing.
This has resulted in difficulty with simply getting to the
bathroom leading to episodes of incontinence. A UA performed on
___ was reassuring. 

On the day of presentation to the hospital, the patient began to
experience visual hallucinations of a motor cross race in his
backyard. He subsequently had a fall while transferring from the
couch to a chair. His wife was unable to get him off the floor.
The fall was witnessed and there was no head strike. Per the
patient's wife, his gait has acutely worsened over the past 24
hours to the point where he has been unable to ambulate on his
own. The patient's daughter called his neurologist who
recommended presentation to the ED. 

In the ED, the patient was afebrile, HRs ___, normotensive, and
SpO2 100% RA. On exam he was noted to have cogwheeling of upper
extremities and decrease ___ strength. Labs were remarkable for a
negative urine and serum tox, Na 132, K 5.8 (hemolyzed and no 
EKG
changes), negative troponin, normal LFTs, unremarkable CBC. 
Chest
Xray showed no acute process and CTH was reassuring. He was
evaluated by neurology who recommended admission to medicine for
failure to thrive, to continue the patient's home medications,
and complete a toxo-metabolic workup. The patient was given his
home pramipexole and pravastatin before he was admitted.  

On arrival to the floor, the patient is comfortable in bed. He 
is
not accompanied by family on my interview. He knows that he is 
in
the hospital and that it is ___. He is not sure why he is here
and begins to tell me about a party in his house with a motor
cross race in his backyard. When I asked him about his fall, he
mentions that he has not had a fall for ___ years. He denies any
fevers, chills, cough, chest pain, abdominal pain, nausea,
diarrhea, or dysuria.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear ___,

You were admitted to the hospital with shortness of breath and 
weight gain.  This was likely caused by an exacerbation of your 
heart failure possibly from salty foods over the holiday. 

While you were in the hospital:
- we gave you IV diuretics to help remove extra fluid
- we checked for pneumonia with a chest x-ray, there was no sign 
of a pneumonia
- we checked for signs on new clots in your legs, there was no 
new clot

Now that you are going home:
- continue to take all of your medications as prescribed
- monitor your salt intake, this should be no more than 2 grams 
every day, ask your doctors for help with this if you do not 
know how to keep track of your salt
- continue to weigh yourself every morning, call your doctor if 
weight goes up more than 3 lbs.
- follow-up with your primary care doctor regarding your blood 
pressure and blood sugar control

It was a pleasure taking care of you!

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ is a ___ year old woman with a past medical 
history of type-2 DM, hypertension, stage IV CKD, CAD s/p 
distant MI and bare metal stent, stroke, recent unprovoked DVTs 
on Coumadin, and recent upper GI bleed, who was sent to ___ by 
her physician for anemia. 

# Anemia: 
Patient presented with Hgb of 6.5, down from her recent baseline 
of ~7.5 since her ___ hospitalization. Upon presentation she 
had a new macrocytic anemia. Hemolysis labs were negative. She 
received two units of packed red cells with an appropriate rise 
in her Hgb to 9.0. Stool was guiac negative, with no reports of 
dark stool or blood in stool. Her hemoglobin remained stable at 
this level, there was no overt bleeding, and her stool was guiac 
negative. After transfusion the patient reported significant 
improvement in her shortness of breath and fatigue. Given her 
history of gastritis and diverticulosis, a GI bleed was believed 
responsible for her anemia. Patient should receive an 
EGD/colonoscopy as an outpatient. 

# Acute exacerbation of heart failure with preserved ejection 
fraction: 
The patient was also found to be slightly volume overloaded, and 
was treated with 2x40mg IV Lasix, with good urine output and 
symptomatic improvement. Her pulmonary edema and peripheral 
edema resolved with diuresis.

CHRONIC ISSUES:
# Gastic ulceration: 
Continued on home pantoprazole BID

# Hypertension:
Continued on home nifedipine, carvadilol, lisinopril.

# Stage IV Chronic Kidney Disease: 
Creatinine remained at baseline (b/l Cr 2.1-2.6) during 
admission.

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES
======================
--Patient's Anemia is thought to be due to slow GI bleed given 
history of gastritis and diverticulosis. Please schedule 
EGD/colonoscopy within the next month
--Patient continued on Coumadin for bilateral DVTs; please 
continue to weigh the risks and benefits of anticoagulation 
given history of bleed.

thrombus on exam. Daily INR trended and continued on home 
Coumadin 5mg daily. 

# Anemia: no signs of external loss, specifically denying any 
melena. Chronically anemic with baseline ___, presented with Hgb 
8. Likely ___ renal disease and ACD however elevated MCV 
indicates possible reticulocytosis. Altogether low suspicion for 
GIB so Coumadin was continued. Reticulocytes 2.4 which is 
inappropriate arguing against acute loss. Trended daily CBC with 
noted uprising by discharge.

# Chronic kidney disease, stage IV- baseline ___, likely ___ 
HTN and DM. Renally dosed medications and trended Cr with no 
significant change. 
# HLD: continued home atorvastatin

","I5023: Acute on chronic systolic (congestive) heart failure - The patient presented with dyspnea on exertion, leg swelling, and weight gain, all indicative of a decompensation of her chronic heart failure. Her BNP was elevated to 10,180, and she had bibasilar crackles and bilateral lower extremity edema, confirming the presence of fluid overload. She was treated with IV diuretics and her symptoms improved.

N184: Chronic kidney disease, stage 4 (severe) - The patient has a documented history of stage IV CKD, with a baseline creatinine of 2.1-2.6. During this hospitalization, her creatinine levels were 2.3 on admission and 1.9 at discharge, consistent with her stage IV CKD.

D631: Anemia in chronic kidney disease - The patient has chronic anemia, with a hemoglobin level of 8.1 on admission and 8.6 at discharge. This is consistent with anemia in the setting of her chronic kidney disease, as evidenced by her elevated creatinine and low hemoglobin levels.

E1121: Type 2 diabetes mellitus with diabetic nephropathy - The patient has a history of diabetes mellitus and her chronic kidney disease is likely secondary to diabetic nephropathy. Her elevated creatinine and BUN, along with her history of diabetes, support this diagnosis.

Z86718: Personal history of other venous thrombosis and embolism - The patient has a documented history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT), which is a form of venous thrombosis.

I129: Hypertensive chronic kidney disease with stage 1 through stage 4 chronic kidney disease, or unspecified chronic kidney disease - The patient has both hypertension and chronic kidney disease, and her hypertension is contributing to her kidney disease. Her creatinine levels and stage IV CKD confirm this diagnosis.

Z955: Presence of coronary angioplasty implant and graft - The patient has a history of CAD with stent placement (DES), indicating the presence of a coronary angioplasty implant and graft.

I2510: Atherosclerobic heart disease of native coronary artery without angina pectoris - The patient has a history of CAD, specifically a myocardial infarction and stent placement, indicating atherosclerotic heart disease of the native coronary arteries.

Z7901: Long term (current) use of anticoagulants - The patient is on warfarin for her history of DVT, indicating long-term use of anticoagulants.

Z794: Long term (current) use of insulin - The patient uses insulin (Humulin 70/30) for her diabetes, indicating long-term use of insulin.

I340: Nonrheumatic mitral (valve) insufficiency - The patient has a history of ischemic mitral regurgitation (MR) due to her CAD, indicating nonrheumatic mitral valve insufficiency.

I252: Old myocardial infarction - The patient has a documented history of a myocardial infarction (MI), indicating an old myocardial infarction.

Z8673: Personal history of transient ischemic attack (TIA), and cerebral infarction without residual deficits - The patient has a history of a cerebellar-medullary stroke (CVA), which is a type of cerebral infarction.

Z87891: Personal history of nicotine dependence - The patient's social history does not mention current smoking, but this code might be used if there is a documented history of smoking in the past.

Z91128: Patient's intentional underdosing of medication regimen for other reason - The patient did not fill her torsemide prescription after her last outpatient cardiology appointment, which could be considered an intentional underdosing of her medication regimen.

E785: Hyperlipidemia, unspecified - The patient is on atorvastatin for lipid management, indicating the presence of hyperlipidemia."

Z87891:Personal history of nicotine dependence
E785:Hyperlipidemia, unspecified
E890:Postprocedural hypothyroidism

Please output the coding reason:<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
","C675: The patient's chief complaint and diagnosis are bladder cancer. The specific mention of the bladder neck is not explicitly stated, but this ICD-10 code is the most appropriate for malignant neoplasm of the bladder, especially given the surgical procedure performed (robotic anterior exenteration and open ileal conduit).

I10: The patient has a past medical history of hypertension, which is listed in the medical record. This is a common condition and is coded as essential (primary) hypertension in the absence of other specified types.

D259: This code is likely incorrect based on the information provided. There is no mention of leiomyoma of the uterus in the medical record. It seems to be an error in coding.

Z87891: There is no mention of nicotine dependence or smoking history in the social or family history sections. This code appears to be incorrectly applied.

E785: The patient is on atorvastatin, which is typically used for managing hyperlipidemia. However, there is no explicit mention of hyperlipidemia in the medical record. This code may be inferred but lacks direct documentation.

E890: There is no mention of hypothyroidism or thyroid issues in the medical record. The patient is on levothyroxine, which could suggest hypothyroidism, but without a clear diagnosis mentioned, this code is not supported by the documentation."

this was not thought to be treatment failure and IVC filter was 
deferred. She had no signs of right heart strain on imaging, 
EKG, exam. TTE showed no evidence of right heart strain. She was 
treated with a heparin gtt, then transitioned to treatment dose 
lovenox given malignancy associated thrombosis as noted in CLOT 
trial. She is quite symptomatic and requires oxygen 
supplementation, though improved during hospitalization. Please 
wean oxygen as tolerated.

# Pulmonary nodules: Known spiculated masses that were noted on 
CT in ___, concerning for primary lung malignancy vs mets. 
Current CT showed stable nodules still concerning for 
malignancy. She was evaluated by the thoracic team who 
recommended CT biopsy vs. surveillance. Given her current 
PE/DVT, the family and the patient decided for surveillance at 
this time. They will follow up with her primary care provider. 

# Enterococcal UTI
She was noted to have rising WBC in the setting of UCX from 
urostomy growing Enterococcus. Given her rising leukocytosis, we 
proceeded with treatment. She was started on IV Ampicillin and 
transitioned to macrobid, based on sensitivies. Leukocytosis 
improved on antibiotics. She should complete a 7 day course (day 
1: ___, day 7: ___. 

# Normocytic Anemia: No signs of bleeding, or hemolysis. Hb 
dropped to nadir of 7.3, stable at discharge at 7.5. Iron 
studies consistent with likely combination iron deficiency 
anemia and anemia of chronic disease with low iron but elevated 
ferritin and low TIBC. Would recommend checking again as 
outpatient and work-up as needed.

# ___ swelling: Likley multifactorial including venous 
insufficiency, as well as known LLE DVT. She responded quite 
well with compression stockings.

# Hx of bladder cancer: s/p ___ TURBT, high-grade TCC, T1 
(no muscle identified). Then in ___, pelvic MRI showed 
bladder mass invasion, perivesical soft tissue, anterior vaginal 
wall on right (C/W T4 lesion). In ___, underwent robotic 
TAH-BSO, lap radical cystectomy and anterior vaginectomy with 
pathology showing pT2b, node and margins negative. No plan for 
any further therapy at this time per Dr ___.

The patient is safe to discharge today, and >30min were spent on 
discharge day management services.

Transitional issues:
- She will need follow up chest CT for pulmonary nodules in 3 
months (___)
- To complete 7 day course for UTI with macrobid (day 7: ___
- Continue oxygen therapy and wean as tolerated to maintain O2

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ was admitted with sepsis from a urinary tract 
infection after her stent exchange. She was placed empirically 
on vancomycin and cefepime (narrowed to vanc/ceftriaxone on 
HD#1), because of her history of resistant organisms. She 
rapidly improved. Her urine grew E. faecium, sensitive to 
ampicillin. Therefore, a PICC line was placed, and she will 
complete two weeks total of ampicillin for a complicated urinary 
tract infection (additional day days). She will follow up with 
Dr. ___ as an outpatient. She will stop her prophylactic TMP 
while on ampicillin, but then resume after finishing her course.
- ampicillin 500 mg TID x 9 additional days
- restart TMP 100 mg daily for ppx after antibiotic course
- follow up with Dr. ___

___ problems addressed this hospitalization:

1. ___. Ms. ___ initially had an ___, likely prerenal from 
her sepsis. She received IV fluids and antibiotics as above, and 
her creatinine down-trended. Losartan was initially held, but 
restarted on discharge.

PERTINENT IMAGING:
==================
CT ABD&PEL W/ CONTRAST 
___
1. Interval decrease in size of the right hemipelvis fluid 
collection (7.0 x 6.5 x 11.3 cm, previously 10.0 x 12.7 x 14.8 
cm) with the anterior approach pigtail catheter unchanged in 
position.  The pigtail is again located partly within the 
collection and partly outside its wall. 
2. Interval increase in size of the left pelvic fluid 
collection, now 
measuring 14.7 x 16.2 x 23.3 cm (previously 13.6 x 13.9 x 23.0 
cm). Increased peripheral enhancement may suggest superimposed 
infection. 
3. No new fluid collection identified. 
  
CTA ABD & PELVIS
___
1. Decrease in size of right lower quadrant fluid collection 
that has 
percutaneous drain within it, with areas of high attenuation on 
noncontrast exam consistent with blood products, and associated 
hyperemia which is likely inflammatory, but without evidence of 
contrast extravasation. 
2. There is large stable fluid collection in the low left 
abdomen, pelvis with mild linear peripheral enhancement, 
infection cannot be excluded. 
3. There is severe left, and moderate to severe right 
hydroureteronephrosis, with delayed left nephrogram, stable from 
today.  Mass effect about anastomosis between distal ureters and 
neobladder has resolved all since ___, and while 
hydronephrosis may be from residual edema, if this does not 
resolve, alternative etiologies including stenosis, tumor 
infiltration should be excluded. 
4. Tiny hepatic lesion segment ___, attention to this area on 
subsequent 
followups recommended. 

CT INTERVENTIONAL PROCEDURE
___ 
1.  Complete collapse the patient has recently drained left 
lower quadrant 
collection.  The catheter from this collection was removed. 
2.  Near complete collapse of the patient is originally drained 
collection in the mid pelvis, with pigtail catheter in place. 
3.  Left lower quadrant and deep pelvic collections as above.  
These findings were discussed with the team.  Given the 
patient's improving clinical status, the decision was made to 
pursue no further collection drainage at this time. 
4.  Severe bilateral hydronephrosis, as on prior examinations. 
RECOMMENDATION:  Given persistence of severe hydronephrosis, 
percutaneous 
nephrostomy tubes should be considered. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
BRIEF SUMMARY:
==============
___ year old women with a history of bladder cancer s/p 
cystectomy, hysterectomy, and BSO now with ileal conduit, whose 
post operative course has been complicated by DVT/PE, ileus, and 
pelvic fluid collections w/ one LLQ drain presented with 
subjective fevers, lethargy, and bloody drain output. She was 
found to have worsening anemia and was given 2 units of pRBC 
with appropriate increase in hemoglobin noted. She was also 
found on CT imaging to have an interval increase in size of a 
left abdominal fluid collection. Decision was made to place a 
drain per ID. Fluid was sent and revealed: negative cultures, 
negative malignant cells, no evidence of lymphatic or urinary 
fluid. This new drain was subsequently removed per ___ as fluid 
collection was completely drained. The prior drain was still 
draining serosanguinous fluid and was kept in but repositioned. 
ID was consulted for the fevers, leukocytosis and fluid 
collections and was deemed to need antibiotics and tranisitioned 
from broad spectrum to IV ertapenem at discharge. Will require 
multiple follow ups and imaging as specified in the transitional 
issues. 
 
ACUTE ISSUES:
=============
#Pelvic fluid collections: patient arrived with one anterior 
drain putting out serosanguinous fluid. CT abdomen/pelvis 
revealed enlarging left fluid collection, and decision was made 
to place a drain per ___. The fluid was negative for malignant 
cells. The fluid had Cr 1 and triglycerides <9 suggesting that 
fluid collection is neither urine nor lymphatic fluid. Fluid 
culture was negative for bacteria. On interval imaging, the new 
enlarging fluid collection had completely collapsed and the 
drain was removed. As for the other fluid collection that 
already had a drain putting out serosanguinous fluid, it 
continued to drain serosanguinous fluid but at a lower rate than 
prior to admission. The drain was left in place as the fluid 
collection on imaging had not completely collapsed. BID - N 
cultures for the aforementioned fluid collection came back 
positive for MSSA but per ID, does not reflect rue 
intra-abdominal infection. Given that patient had a fever at OSH 
and a leukocytosis, she was placed on broad spectrum antibiotics 
with vanc, ceftaz and flagyl. This was tapered per ID team to IV 
zosyn. On discharge, ID recommended ertapenem for approximately 
4 weeks with final length of treatment to be determined by fluid 
collection changes on repeat imaging on outpatient basis. Mrs. 
___ remained afebrile, and leukocytosis resolved. 

#Pulmonary embolism: Likely developed in the setting of being 
diagnosed with a post-op DVT. She was placed on lovenox.  She 
was transitioned to heparin ggt as she needed ___ procedures and 
was transitioned back to lovenox but at a lower dose per weight 
dosing to 70mg q12H upon discharge. 

#Acute renal injury: SCr has been steadily rising from a 
baseline of around 0.04-0.06 in ___ to 1.1, likely 
___ obstructed uropathy ___ large pelbic fluid collections. ___ 
resolved over the course of her hospital stay with final Cr 0.8. 


#Hydronephrosis: bilateral and worsening on interval imaging 
from prior studies. Given patient's age, adequate urinary 
output, adequate creatinine clearance, and no significant 
electrolyte abnormalities, patient likely would not 
significantly benefit from intervention at this time. Per 
urology consult, deemed stable for discharge and recommended 
outpatient urology followup. 

#Anemia: likely a combination of anemia of chronic inflammation 
and acute blood loss ___ to anterior abdominal drain showing 
serosanguinous fluid. Labs not consistent with hemolysis. 
Received 2 units of pRBC with appropriate response. Patient was 
discharged with Hgb of 8.3 per hem/onc recommendation for 
threshold Hgb>8 as patient feels and functionally performs 
better with higher blood counts. 

#Hypokalemia: was hypokalemic and was repleted with oral KCl 
PRN. 

CHRONIC ISSUES:
===============
#Invasive high-grade urothelial carcinoma, involving the deep 
muscularis propria
S/p cystectomy, hysterectomy, and BSO now with ileal conduit, 
whose post operative course has been complicated by DVT/PE, 
ileus, and pelvic fluid collections.  Patient stating that there 
is no plan for chemo and radiation, her PET scan does show 
concerning foci of metastatic disease in the lung and 
peritoneum. Per patient's son, Mrs. ___ has seen a doctor 
to work up the lung mass. Will need ongoing discussion with 
outpatient hem/onc regarding how to best manage concerning 
lesions. 

#Breast mass ___ mammogram showing BI-RADS 5, Solid mass 
in the 3 o'clock left breast with features of a highly 
suspicious for malignancy. Per patient's son, she has seen a 
doctor for evaluating the new breast mass. Would recommend 
ongoing discussion with aforementioned doctor and outpatient 
hem/onc about plan to manage.

# HLD: continued atorvastatin without changes. Consider 
evaluation regarding stopping atorvastatin on outpatient basis 
 
# Hypothyroidism: continued levothyroxine without changes.   
  
#HCP:  Dr. ___ (son, ___ physician) ___
#Code status: full code (confirmed with patient on ___ 

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:

","T814XXA: Infection following a procedure, initial encounter - The patient developed an infection related to the pelvic fluid collections, which required the placement and repositioning of drains. This is indicated in the history of present illness and the imaging results showing fluid collections with signs of infection.

A419: Sepsis, unspecified organism - The patient had a high white blood cell count (WBC-19.4), fever, and positive blood cultures for MSSA, which are indicators of sepsis. Although the specific organism is not identified, the clinical presentation supports the diagnosis of sepsis.

K651: Peritoneal abscess - The CT imaging showed multiple fluid collections in the pelvis, with one showing increased peripheral enhancement suggestive of infection. This is consistent with a peritoneal abscess.

N179: Acute kidney failure, unspecified - The patient had an elevated creatinine level (from a baseline of around 0.04-0.06 to 1.1) during the hospital stay, indicating acute kidney failure. The cause was attributed to obstructive uropathy due to the pelvic fluid collections.

N1330: Unspecified hydronephrosis - Imaging showed severe bilateral hydronephrosis, which was stable but required monitoring and potential intervention.

D62: Acute posthemorrhagic anemia - The patient had a significant drop in hemoglobin (from 6.9 to 8.3) and required two units of packed red blood cells (pRBC), indicating acute posthemorrhagic anemia.

I2782: Chronic pulmonary embolism - The patient has a history of a postoperative DVT/PE and was on anticoagulation therapy. The condition is described as chronic in the summary.

N138: Other obstructive and reflux uropathy - The imaging showed severe bilateral hydronephrosis, which could be due to obstructive uropathy, although the exact cause was not definitively determined.

C679: Malignant neoplasm of bladder, unspecified - The patient has a history of high-grade invasive urothelial carcinoma of the bladder, which is a primary diagnosis in her medical history.

I10: Essential (primary) hypertension - The patient has a history of hypertension, which is listed in her past medical history.

E785: Hyperlipidemia, unspecified - The patient is on atorvastatin, indicating a history of hyperlipidemia.

E039: Hypothyroidism, unspecified - The patient is on levothyroxine, indicating a history of hypothyroidism.

K439: Ventral hernia without obstruction or gangrene - This code might be incorrectly applied as there is no mention of a ventral hernia in the medical record.

K435: Parastomal hernia without obstruction or gangrene - This code might be incorrectly applied as there is no mention of a parastomal hernia in the medical record.

E876: Hypokalemia - The patient had hypokalemia, which was managed with oral potassium supplementation.

Y838: Other surgical procedures as the cause of abnormal reaction of the patient, or of later complication, without mention of misadventure at the time of the procedure - This code is used to indicate that the pelvic fluid collections and subsequent infections were complications of prior surgical procedures.

Y929: Unspecified place or not applicable - This code is typically used for external causes of morbidity but does not seem applicable in this context.

Z96652: Presence of left artificial knee joint - The patient has a history of a left knee replacement, which is documented in her past medical history.

Z86718: Personal history of other venous thrombosis and embolism - The patient has a history of a DVT/PE, which is documented in her past medical history.

N63: Unspecified lump in breast - The patient has a breast mass that is BI-RADS 5, which is highly suspicious for malignancy.

Z7901: Long term (current) use of anticoagulants - The patient is on enoxaparin for DVT/PE prophylaxis, which is documented in her discharge medications.

Z87891: Personal history of nicotine dependence - This code might be incorrectly applied as there is no mention of nicotine dependence in the medical record."

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ is an ___ year old woman with history of provoked 
DVT/PE (on lovenox), bladder cancer s/p Robotic TAH-BSO, lap 
radical cystectomy with ileal loop diversion and anterior 
vaginectomy in ___ c/b abdominal fluid requiring 
placement of drainage catheters, and recent hydronephrosis 
requiring placement of bilateral PCN tubes on ___, presenting 
from rehab with hematuria and weakness.

On arrival, pt had evidence of frank hematuria in her urostomy 
bag and PCN tubes. Her hemoglobin was initially 8.1, which 
subsequently dropped to 7.0 Her lovenox was held, and she was 
transfused with 1 U PRBC with an appropriate hemoglobin bump to 
8.2. Hematuria was likely caused by recent instrumentation in 
the setting of anticoagulation. Her hematuria improved, as did 
her dizziness/weakness. ___ was consulted and recommending 
capping her PCN tubes. After discussion with the patient's 
hematologist, it was decided to stop her lovenox treatment given 
that her DVT/PE were provoked in the setting of her recovery 
from surgery, and that she had received almost 6 months of 
treatment.

Secondary Issues:

# Asymptomatic bacteruria: Patient with asymptomatic bacteruria 
in setting of recent procedural manipulation. She was afebrile 
and without leukocytosis, so treatment with antibiotics was 
deferred.

# Hyperlipidemia: continued atorvastatin 10 mg daily

# Hypothyroidism: continue levothyroxine 175 mcg daily

walks with a walker because of knee replacement. Finally, got up 
out of chair with walker and walked to the door to unlock. She 
noticed problems talking to family members. She had difficulty 
forming words and pronouncing words. Denies word finding 
difficulty. She could tell it was slurred like a person who had 
too much to drink. EMTs asked if she was intoxicated but she was 
not. She was very aware of her dysarthria and told her daughters 
that she thinks she's having a stroke. Then, she said she had 
trouble sitting down but has no idea why she thought that. When 
she was standing, she was able to walk with walker but she felt 
unsteady and almost fell. No visual changes. No numbness or 
tingling. Denies focal weakness; she just had trouble standing 
up. She was able to unlock her door without issue but she felt 
shaky. 

She was brought by EMS to ___ where NIHSS was 1 for 
slurred speech. There, she felt the same but her symptoms

baseline and she normally uses hearing aids. 

For the past ___ months, she has had ___ nocturia nightly. No 
dysuria. 

She has noticed more frequent headaches lately in the past ___ 
months. Last headache was yesterday. She takes tramadol and 
acetaminophen up to a couple times a night. She reports

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ is a ___ year old female with AFib on Eliquis, CHF, 
HLD, HTN who presented w/ sudden onset dysarthria, abnormal arm 
movements, and poor balance (walker at baseline). NIHSS 1 for 
slurred speech at OSH. There, a CTA head and neck was completed, 
and there was concern for left M2 branch attenuation concerning 
for stenosis or occlusion, and she was subsequently transferred 
for consideration of thrombectomy but NIHSS 0 on arrival so she 
was not deemed a candidate. She was admitted to the Neurology 
stroke service for further evaluation of possible TIA vs stroke. 
No further symptoms noted during admission. MRI head w/o 
contrast were without evidence of stroke. Reports recent 
echocardiogram per outpatient PCP/cardiologist, reported as no 
acute findings and so this was not repeated. She mentioned 
concern about worsening memory, but able to perform ADLs w/ 
meals/cleaning provided by ALF (moved 10 months ago); it appears 
there has been no acute change. She was taking apixiban 2.5mg 
once daily (unclear why as this is a BID medication), and so her 
dose was increased to 2.5mg BID (she was not a candidate for 5mg 
BID due to her age and weight). She was started on atorvastatin 
for her hyperlipidemia (LDL 126). EP cardiology was consulted 
for frequent sinus pauses noted on telemetry that persisted 
despite holding home atenolol, recommending discontinuing home 
digoxin and close cardiology ___. Discharged to home w/ 
___ & ___ and close PCP ___.

#Transient slurred speech and instability, c/f TIA
- ___ consult - cleared for home with home services
- Started on atorvastatin for HLD and increased home apixaban to 
therapeutic level
- ___ with stroke neurology after discharge

Her stroke risk factors include the following:
1) DM: A1c 5.5%
2) Likely chronic segmental left vertebral artery occlusion and 
somewhat small caliber attenuated left M2 inferior branch
3) Hyperlipidemia: LDL 126
4) Obesity
5) No concern noted for sleep apnea - she does not carry the 
diagnosis
An echocardiogram did not show a PFO on bubble study.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___,

You were hospitalized due to symptoms of slurred speech due to 
concern for an ACUTE ISCHEMIC STROKE, a condition where a blood 
vessel providing oxygen and nutrients to the brain is blocked by 
a clot. The brain is the part of your body that controls and 
directs all the other parts of your body, so damage to the brain 
from being deprived of its blood supply can result in a variety 
of symptoms. However, the MRI of your brain did not show 
evidence of stroke or TIA. Your symptoms could have been related 
to blood pressure, dehydration, alcohol use, or a combination of 
these factors.

We are changing your medications as follows:
Increase apixaban to 2.5mg twice daily
Start Vitamin B12 daily supplement

Please take your other medications as prescribed.

Please follow up with your primary care physician as listed 
below. You should also follow up with your cardiologist as you 
were noted to have occasional pauses on cardiac monitoring.

If you experience any of the symptoms below, please seek 
emergency medical attention by calling Emergency Medical 
Services (dialing 911). In particular, please pay attention to 
the sudden onset and persistence of these symptoms:
- Sudden partial or complete loss of vision
- Sudden loss of the ability to speak words from your mouth
- Sudden loss of the ability to understand others speaking to 
you
- Sudden weakness of one side of the body
- Sudden drooping of one side of the face
- Sudden loss of sensation of one side of the body

Sincerely,
Your ___ Neurology Team

","R471: The patient presented with transient dysarthria, which is slurred speech, and this was a significant focus of the evaluation and treatment. The initial concern was for a possible TIA or stroke, and the diagnosis of ""transient dysarthria not secondary to TIA or stroke"" was made.

I5030: The patient has a history of congestive heart failure (CHF), which is noted in the Past Medical History section. Although the specific type of heart failure is not specified, the code I5030 (Unspecified diastolic (congestive) heart failure) is used.

E538: The patient was found to have a mild Vitamin B12 deficiency (B12 level of 249), and she was started on Vitamin B12 supplements. This condition is coded as E538 (Deficiency of other specified B group vitamins).

Z66: There is no mention of a Do Not Resuscitate (DNR) order in the medical record, so this code seems incorrect and should be reviewed.

I4891: The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation, which is managed with apixaban. This is noted in the Past Medical History section and is coded as I4891 (Unspecified atrial fibrillation).

Z7902: The patient is on long-term anticoagulation therapy with apixaban, which is noted in the discharge medications. This is coded as Z7902 (Long term (current) use of antithrombotics/antiplatelets).

I110: The patient has a history of hypertension and heart failure, which is noted in the Past Medical History section. This is coded as I110 (Hypertensive heart disease with heart failure).

E7849: The patient has hyperlipidemia, which is noted in the Past Medical History section and was managed with the initiation of atorvastatin. This is coded as E7849 (Other hyperlipidemia).

K5790: The patient has a history of diverticulosis, which is noted in the Past Medical History section. This is coded as K5790 (Diverticulosis of intestine, part unspecified, without perforation or abscess without bleeding).

Z87891: There is no mention of a personal history of nicotine dependence in the medical record, so this code seems incorrect and should be reviewed.

R946: The patient had an elevated TSH level (5.8), which is noted in the lab results. This is coded as R946 (Abnormal results of thyroid function studies).

I455: The patient had frequent sinus pauses noted on telemetry, which suggests a heart block. This is coded as I455 (Other specified heart block).

R413: There is no mention of amnesia or memory loss in the discharge diagnosis, although the patient's family reported a decline in memory. However, since amnesia is not specifically diagnosed, this code seems incorrect and should be reviewed."

Brief Hospital Course:
___ yo F with history of COPD on home O2, atrial fibrillation on 
apixaban, hypertension, CAD, hyperlipidemia, and recurrent 
hospitalization for COPD exacerbation over the last 4 months, 
who presented with dyspnea and increased wheezing secondary to 
severe COPD.
 
#Recurrent COPD exacerbation: Patient presented with increased 
dyspnea and diffuse wheezing, likely secondary to COPD 
exacerbation. She has a history of multiple recurrent COPD 
hospitalizations. According to Pulmonary, patient has severe 
COPD based on her obstructive deficits on PFTs as well as her 
severe symptoms even at rest, as well as her more frequent 
exacerbations and is likely approaching end-stage disease. We 
continued Advair 500/50 BID, Spiriva, standing nebulizers, and 
theophylline. Pulmonary recommended additional budesonide 
inhalers to allow reduction of PO prednisone dose. Prednisone 
dose was increased back to 40mg (where patient was better) with 
a plan for slow wean by 5mg every 2 weeks. Also, patient was 
started on chronic azithromycin for chronic anti-inflammation; 
after discussion with Dr. ___ was agreed to stop 
azithromycin on discharge due to inability to monitor QT the 
week after discharge, with plan to restart azithromycin once Dr. 
___ is able to see the patient. Patient did not want to go to 
pulmonary rehab. She was seen by Palliative Care who recommended 
initiation of morphine liquid suspension as needed for shortness 
of breath.

# Acute kidney injury: Creatinine was slightly elevated to 1.2 
from a baseline of 1.0. She likely had poor PO intake. 
Creatinine on discharge was 0.9.
 
CHRONIC ISSUES:  
==================  
# Anxiety/Insomnia: We continued home lorazepam.
 
# Atrial fibrillation: We continued diltiazem for rate control 
and apixaban for anticoagulation.  
 
# Hypertension: We continued home imdur, hydrochlorothiazide, 
and diltiazem.  
 
# CAD: Cardiac catheterization in ___ showed no evidence of 
significant stenosis of coronaries. ECHO on ___ showed EF > 
55% and no regional or global wall motion abnormalities. We 
continued home aspirin and atorvastatin.
 
# Anemia: We continued home iron supplements. 

***TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:*** 
- Continue Advair 500/50 BID, Spiriva, and theophylline 
- Make sure patient receives standing nebulizers 
- Added additional budesonide inhalers to allow reduction of PO 
prednisone dose 
- Start chronic azithromycin for chronic anti-inflammation. 
(Patient was started on azithromycin in the hospital and QTc on 
___ was 472 ms. ___ discussion with Dr. ___ was agreed 
to stop azithromycin on discharge due to inability to monitor QT 
the week after discharge, with the plan to restart azithromycin 
once Dr. ___ is able to see the patient.)
- Would recommend audiology testing at some point while patient 
is on chronic azithromycin
- Continue supplemental oxygen for comfort
- Follow up with Dr. ___ discharge 
- Continue Bactrim PPX (1 tab SS daily) given extended courses 
of steroids 
- Patient was discharged on prednisone 40 mg with plan for taper 
by 5mg every 2 weeks:
 Prednisone 40 mg for two weeks (Day 1= ___ end 
___
 Prednisone 35 mg for two weeks (Day 1= ___ end 
___
 Prednisone 30 mg for two weeks (Day 1= ___ end 
___

started at 40mg daily with slow taper. She was also given 
azithromycin to complete 5 day course. She had improvement in 
her wheezing and returned to baseline O2 requirement after 48 
hours. She was seen by ___ who felt that she would benefit from 
discharge to inpatient pulmonary rehabilitation program. On DC 
to ___ rehab, recommended continued Prendisone 40mg 
daily for 1x week with slow taper by 5mg every 5 days. ___ also 
consider starting bactrim ppx with extended duration of steroids 
if unable to wean less than 20mg qd. Will also f/u as outpatient 
with pulm.

CHRONIC ISSUES: 
==================
# Anxiety/Insomnia: Continued home lorazepam. Consider starting 
SRRI as an outpatient. 
# Atrial Fibrillation: Continued dilt for rate control and 
apixaban for anticoagulation.
# Hypertension: Continued home imdur, hydrochlorothiazide, and 
diltiazem.
# CAD: Cardiac catheterization in ___ without evidence of 
significant stenosis of coronaries. ECHO on ___ with EF > 
55% and no regional or global wall motion abnormalities. 
Continued home aspirin and atorvastatin.
# Anemia: Continued home iron supplements.

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
==========================

SELECT IMAGING:
===============
___ CXR:  
COMPARISON: ___  
FINDINGS:  
 Heart size is mildly enlarged. There is mild unfolding of the 
thoracic aorta. Cardiomediastinal silhouette and hilar contours 
are otherwise unremarkable. There is mild bibasilar atelectasis. 
Lungs are otherwise clear. Pleural surfaces are clear without 
effusion or pneumothorax. Focus of air seen under the right 
hemidiaphragm, likely represents colonic interposition.  
IMPRESSION:No acute cardiopulmonary abnormality.  

___ RUE U/S:
 IMPRESSION: 4 cm acute deep vein thrombosis noted within the 
mid right brachial vein as detailed above. 

___ CXR:
 IMPRESSION: The endotracheal tube tip is 6 cm above the carina. 
 Nasogastric tube tip is beyond the GE junction and off the edge 
of the film.  A left central line is present in the tip is in 
the mid SVC.  A pacemaker is noted on the right in the lead 
projects over the right ventricle.  There is probable scarring 
in both lung apices.  There are no new areas of consolidation.  
There is upper zone redistribution and cardiomegaly suggesting 
pulmonary venous hypertension. There is no pneumothorax. 
 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ hx severe COPD, AFib, CAD, HTN, HLD, recent hospitalizations 
for recurrent COPD exacerbations over the last several months, 
who presented with dyspnea and increased wheezing secondary to 
severe COPD. 

She was treated for her COPD with nebulizers and steroids, but 
continued to decline eventually suffering a PEA arrest thought 
due to hypoxemia requiring endotracheal intubation and 
mechanical ventilation. A temporary pacemaker was placed for 
periods of bradycardia that may also have contributed to her PEA 
arrest (versus being a manifestation of severe hypoxemia/severe 
hypercarbia preceding her arrest). She made a cognitive recovery 
but was unable to be successfully weaned from her ventilator. 
She had capacity and was able to make it understand that she did 
not wish: continued intubation & mechanical ventilation; 
re-intubation and mechanical ventilation once extubated; or, 
positive non-invasive pressure ventilation. After extensive 
discussions with her and her family, she was transitioned to 
DNR/DNI and comfort-oriented care. She was extubated to spend 
quality time with her family before passing from respiratory 
failure on the morning of ___ at 0515. Autopsy was declined 
by family.

She was incidentally found to have a RUE DVT that was treated 
with heparin gtt (which was also used for anticoagulation for 
her atrial fibrillation; she was temporarily transitioned to 
argatroban for concern of HIT, but PF4 antibodies returned at 
very low OD, making this diagnosis unlikely). She was also 
treated for an acute sinusitis with Augmentin during her 
hospital stay.

ACTIVE PROBLEMS
#GI Bleed: Presented to PCP with melena and wiping BRBPR. CBC 
was taken and Hgb found to drop from 11.3->8.8. Two large bore 
IVs were placed, started on IV PPI, and she was type and 
screened. Vitals remained stable, so patient was continued on 
home rivaroxaban. She was evaluated by GI who recommended upper 
GI endoscopy, which showed no evidence of bleeding. She remained 
hemodynamically stable throughout the admission. Hgb 9.1 on day 
of discharge. She was discharged home on both her Xarelto and 
ASA.

#SOB: Long standing history of smoking and COPD. Progressive 
exertional dyspnea despite use of Spiriva, advair, fluticasone 
nasal spray, theophylline, and albuterol nebulizers. Has 
increased rescue inhaler use.  Etiology unclear, does not appear 
to be infectious given chronicity. Most likely is progression of 
underlying COPD. PFT's were obtained while in-house. Smoking 
cessation was also discussed. Will need continued outpatient f/u 
re: her COPD.

CHRONIC PROBLEMS
#Afib: Continued home amiodarone and diltiazem. Continued 
rivaroxaban for anticoagulation, as discussed above.

#HTN: Stable, continued on home diltiazem, Imdur, HCTZ

#Anxiety/insomnia: stable, continued home lorazepam QHS PRN for 
insomnia/anxiety.

#Dry eyes: History of glaucoma. Continued home latanoprost 
ophthalmic drops.

#PAD: Stable, continued on home atorvastatin, s/p iliac stent. 
OK to continue aspirin as well.

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
- Should consider outpatient colonoscopy to potentially identify 
any source of lower GI Bleed.
- Given stable hemoglobin/hematocrit while inpatient as well as 
no evidence of bleeding on EGD, her Xarelto and Aspirin were 
continued on discharge
- Was treated with IV PPI while inpatient, but given no evidence 
of active bleeding, was discharged on home Ranitidine 300mg PO 
daily
- Continue to encourage smoking cessation

Z006:Encounter for examination for normal comparison and control in clinical research program

Please output the coding reason:<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
","J441: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with (acute) exacerbation - The patient presented with dyspnea, wheezing, and increased oxygen requirements, which are consistent with an acute exacerbation of COPD. The patient also has a history of COPD and has had multiple prior admissions for dyspnea related to COPD exacerbations.

J45909: Unspecified asthma, uncomplicated - The patient has a history of asthma, which is listed in her past medical history. However, there is no specific mention of an asthma exacerbation during this hospital stay, hence it is coded as unspecified asthma, uncomplicated.

H6991: Unspecified Eustachian tube disorder, right ear - The patient reported decreased hearing in the right ear with fullness for the past 4 days. On examination, the right tympanic membrane was noted to be bulging, which suggests a Eustachian tube disorder.

F419: Anxiety disorder, unspecified - The patient has a history of anxiety, which is listed in her past medical history. There is no specific exacerbation or new symptoms of anxiety noted during this hospital stay, so it is coded as unspecified anxiety disorder.

G4700: Insomnia, unspecified - The patient has a history of insomnia, which is listed in her past medical history. There is no specific exacerbation or new symptoms of insomnia noted during this hospital stay, so it is coded as unspecified insomnia.

I4891: Unspecified atrial fibrillation - The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation, which is listed in her past medical history. She is on apixaban for anticoagulation, indicating ongoing management of atrial fibrillation. There is no specific mention of an atrial fibrillation exacerbation during this hospital stay, so it is coded as unspecified atrial fibrillation.

Z7901: Long term (current) use of anticoagulants - The patient is on apixaban for anticoagulation, indicating long-term use of anticoagulants.

I10: Essential (primary) hypertension - The patient has a history of hypertension, which is listed in her past medical history. She is on multiple medications for hypertension, including imdur, hydrochlorothiazide, and diltiazem.

I2510: Atherosclerotic heart disease of native coronary artery without angina pectoris - The patient has a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), which is listed in her past medical history. She has been on aspirin and atorvastatin for management of CAD. There is no specific mention of angina during this hospital stay.

D649: Anemia, unspecified - The patient has a history of anemia, which is listed in her past medical history. She is on iron supplements for management of anemia. There is no specific mention of anemia exacerbation during this hospital stay, so it is coded as unspecified anemia.

E785: Hyperlipidemia, unspecified - The patient has a history of hyperlipidemia, which is listed in her past medical history. She is on atorvastatin for management of hyperlipidemia. There is no specific mention of hyperlipidemia exacerbation during this hospital stay, so it is coded as unspecified hyperlipidemia.

Z87891: Personal history of nicotine dependence - The patient has a history of COPD and asthma, which are often associated with smoking. Although not explicitly mentioned, the presence of these conditions and the need for home oxygen therapy suggest a history of smoking, thus coding for personal history of nicotine dependence.

Z006: Encounter for examination for normal comparison and control in clinical research program - This code seems less applicable based on the provided information. The patient was admitted for an exacerbation of COPD and other acute symptoms, rather than for a routine examination or clinical research program. This code might be better replaced with a more appropriate code, such as Z99.81 (Dependence on drugs, other specified drugs) if long-term steroid use is a concern."

is currently on prednisone 25 mg QD.

She reports that her SOB improved slightly after starting the 
steroids on ___. However, last night it acutely worsened and she 
was unable to sleep. She usually uses 3 pillows to sleep but was 
only comfortable seated upright last night. This morning she 
increased her oxygen to 3L and felt better. She is usually on 2L 
NC at home. She reports that for the last several months she has 
been using two different albuterol inhalers each every ___ 
hours. She knows that this is more than they are prescribed for 
but it makes her comfortable. She mostly stays put on the second 
floor of her home. She states that she can walk to the bathroom 
without being short of breath, but does not use the stairs 
unless she has to leave the house because it worsens her 
breathing. She endorses a cough occasionally productive of ___ 
sputum. This is consistent with her baseline. She endorses one 
episode of non-exertional chest pain today that spontaneously 
resolved. She denies fever, chills, recent sick contacts, and 
lower extremity edema.

In the ED, initial vital signs were: T 98.5 P 80 BP 154/97 R 20 
O2 sat 97% NC.  
- Exam notable for: Diffuse expiratory wheezing, prolonged 
expiratory phase, left inspiratory crackles, irregularly 
irregular rhthym, minimal pedal edema  
- Labs were notable for CBC wnl, proBNP 235, Trop 0.02, chem 
notable for bicarb 31, AG 13, UA notable for 40 RBCs  
- Studies performed include CXR with stable mild/moderate 
cardiomegaly, atelectasis at bases, otherwise clear lung fields
- Patient was given Albuterol neb x 1, ipratropium neb x 1, 
Azithromycin 500 mg PO, Prednisone 25 mg PO

Upon arrival to the floor, the patient states that she is doing 
well. She says that her SOB has improved since this morning and 
is better than last night when she could not sleep.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ is a ___ y/o woman with a PMH notable for COPD on 
home O2 (hospitalized ___, multiple recent ED visits), Afib 
on apixaban, HTN, CAD, and HLD who presented with dyspnea and 
orthopnea in the setting of a steroid taper for recent COPD 
exacerbation. Her dyspnea was thought to be multifactorial due 
to her severe COPD and with a component of anxiety. The patient 
was not thought to be having an acute COPD exacerbation.

================
ACTIVE ISSUES:
================

# Dyspnea: Patient was admitted after one night of worsened 
orthopnea and dyspnea in the setting of a steroid taper from 30 
mg to 25 mg. Her dyspnea was thought to be multifactorial due to 
her severe COPD and with a component of anxiety. The patient was 
not thought to be having an acute COPD exacerbation. The patient 
was treated with occasional duonebs and lorazepam 0.5 mg PRN 
that helped relieve her dyspnea. Pulmonology was consulted. The 
patient underwent CT that showed emphysema but no evidence of 
infection such as ___. The patient was initiated on a steroid 
taper on ___ of prednisone 30 mg for 3 days, then 20 mg for 3 
days, then 10 mg until outpatient follow-up. Pulmonology 
recommended increasing her Advair dose to 500/50, which was 
done. They also recommended switching from theophylline to 
roflumilast and initiation of long-term azithromycin therapy 
provided the patient's QTc was not prolonged; this was deferred 
to the outpatient setting. Throughout her admission she had O2 
sats greater than 95% on 2L NC. She did not desaturate on 
ambulation. 

# Anxiety/Insomnia: Patient with a history of anxiety and 
insomnia, thought to be contributing to her experience of 
dyspnea. The patient was discharged with lorazepam Q8H as needed 
for anxiety. The patient would likely benefit from therapy with 
an SSRI.

# Demand Ischemia: Patient with troponin 0.02, <0.01, then 0.02. 
ECG without acute ischemic changes.

# Microscopic hematuria: On admission the patient had a UA with 
40 RBCs. Occasional UAs over the last year in OMR with 
microscopic hematuria. Would recommend repeat UA as an 
outpatient or work-up for microscopic hematuria.

================
CHRONIC ISSUES:
================

# Smoking: Patient recently quit smoking one month ago. Patient 
was provided with a nicotine patch 7 mg while in house; could 
consider continuing as an outpatient if patient endorses 
cravings.

# Atrial fibrillation: Patient continued on diltiazem 240 mg PO 
BID and apixaban 5 mg BID.

# HTN: Patient with a history of hypertension. Blood pressure 
well-controlled. Continued on isosorbide mononitrate ER 240 mg 
PO daily and hydrochlorothiazide 50 mg PO daily.

# CAD: Cardiac catheterization in ___ without evidence of 
significant stenosis of coronaries. ECHO on ___ with EF>55% 
and no regional or global wall motion abnormalities. The patient 
was continued on aspirin 81 mg daily and atorvastatin 10 mg QPM.

===================
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
===================
#New Medications:
-Prednisone 30 mg PO QD through ___, then on ___ mg for 3 
days, then on ___ mg until outpatient follow-up
-Increased Advair (Fluticasone-Salmeterol) to 500/50 dose
-Lorazepam 0.5 mg PO Q8H PRN for anxiety

#Follow-up:
-Appointment arranged with PCP, ___ ___
-Appointment arranged with Pulmonologist, Dr. ___, ___

#COPD: Patient was seen by pulmonology during admission who had 
the following recommendations to consider as an outpatient.
-Switch to roflumilast from theophylline
-Daily azithromycin for treatment of chronic inflammation 
provided QTc within normal limits.
-Patient may benefit from treatment of anxiety with an SSRI, as 
her anxiety is likely contributing to her experience of dyspnea.
-In the future, palliative care consult for consideration of 
opioid treatment of dyspnea

#Microscopic hematuria: Patient had a UA with 40 RBCs on 
admission 
-Recommend repeat UA as an outpatient or work-up for microscopic 
hematuria

#Lung nodule: New left lower lobe nodule, potentially measuring 
as large as 6 x 8 mm, warrants close follow-up.  Stable to 
slightly smaller 4 mm right middle lobe nodule. Follow-up CT in 
___ months as per ___ guidelines for evaluation 
of new left lower lobe pulmonary nodule.

#Code Status: Full code
#Emergency Contact/HCP: ___ (HUSBAND) ___

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___,

It was a privilege taking care of you during your admission to 
___. You were admitted to the hospital for 
shortness of breath and concern that you were having a flare of 
your COPD.

While in the hospital we increased your dose of steroids to help 
your breathing. You also received several nebulizer treatments 
that helped your breathing. You were also expressing some 
anxiety that may have been contributing to your shortness of 
breath. You were given a medication called Ativan for your 
anxiety that also seemed to help your breathing.

During your admission you were seen by the pulmonary 
specialists. They recommended a CT scan that showed that you 
have extensive COPD but did not show any infection. They also 
suggested increasing the dose of your Advair inhaler, which we 
did.

If you feel short of breath, first please check your oxygen 
level. If it is less than 90, you can use oxygen and your 
inhaler. If not, try to wait a few minutes, take a few deep 
breaths and see if your shortness of breath improves. You can 
use the medication called Ativan(lorazepam) to help with the 
shortness of breath(no more than three times a day). If still 
not improved, you can use one of the inhalers/oxygen. 

Please follow-up with all your appointments as listed below and 
continue to take all of your medications as prescribed. If you 
experience any of the danger signs listed you should call your 
doctor immediately or go to the Emergency Room.

We wish you the best!

Sincerely,
Your ___ Care Team

Brief Hospital Course:
___ is a ___ with a history of CAD, PVD, and 
COPD and history of recurrent chest pain who presented with afib 
with RVR and COPD exacerbation. 
  
ACUTE PROBLEMS:

#COPD exacerbation: Ms. ___ had had two recent ED visits 
for COPD exacerbation, most recently ___ when she was started 
on prednisone 60 mg. She presented to her PCP's office with 
worsening dyspnea despite this therapy and was also complaining 
of nasal congestion, suggesting a viral URI trigger. In clinic 
she was also noted to be in afib with RVR so was referred to the 
ED where she was admitted after control of her heart rate (see 
below). On admission to the floor, she was noted to have 
wheezing, increased work of breathing, and poor air movement. 
She was treated with 125 mg solumedrol and maintained on 60 mg 
PO prednisone daily. Her home theophylline was decreased from 
400 mg BID to ___ mg BID due to concerns it was contributing to 
her tachyarrhythmia. She was placed on ipratropium nebs q6h, 
albuterol nebs q2h, and fluticasone-salmeterol. Pulmonary was 
consulted and recommended a trial of diuresis so she received 10 
mg IV Lasix as well. Azithromycin was not given due to concerns 
for QT prolongation with theophylline and amiodarone (QTc was 
460). She was started on a 5 day course of ceftriaxone instead, 
and discharged to finish the course with cefpodoxime. She was 
discharged with a prednisone taper (10 mg decrease q3d until at 
10 mg, then stay at 10 mg until pulm follow up) as well as 
follow up with pulmonary rehab and a pulmonologist she 
previously followed with, Dr. ___. She was also discharged on 
2L supplemental O2 to be worn at all times. 

#Atrial fibrillation: Ms. ___ has known atrial 
fibrillation for which she was on amiodarone and apixaban but 
was found to have HR in the 120s in her PCP's office, prompting 
her referral to the ED. Her COPD exacerbation was the likely 
precipitant, with medications also possibly contributing, 
particularly theophylline. She was started on a diltiazem gtt in 
the ED to control her rates than transitioned to diltiazem 90 mg 
q6h. After arrival to the floor, her rates remained controlled. 
Her amiodarone and apixaban were continued. Her theophylline was 
decreased to 200 mg BID from 400 mg BID.

#Iron deficiency anemia. Patient was found to have microcytic 
anemia with low iron and ferritin. She was started on IV iron 
125 mg ferric gluconate x4 doses and wasdischarged on PO iron 
with a bowel regimen. Her H/H was stable throughout the 
hospitalized; there was no evidence of bleeding.

Transitional issues:
- patient discharged on prednisone taper: decrease by 10 mg 
every 3 days until at 10 mg, then keep at 10 mg until seen by 
pulmonology
- patient discharged with plan to follow up with pulmonology and 
pulmonary rehab. Can call ___ to schedule appointment 
with pulmonary rehab.
- patient discharged on with 2 days of cefpodoxime to complete 5 
day course of antibiotics for severe COPD exacerbation
- patient discharged with O2 concentrator for continuous home O2
- patient's theophylline decreased from 300 mg BID to ___ mg BID 
due to her afib with RVR; may want to consider further 
theophylline wean, and addition of azithromycin (if QTc is 
decreased as patient also on amiodarone), and/or roflumilast 
therapy
- patient found to be iron deficient, started on IV iron 
repletion, discharged on PO iron
- patient found to have elevated TSH, please follow up free T4 
which was pending on discharge

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___,

You were hospitalized at ___ 
because you were having difficulty breathing and were found in 
clinic to have a fast heart rate. Your difficulty breathing was 
due to your COPD flaring. Your fast heart rate was due to your 
atrial fibrillation, which is an irregular heart rate that can 
sometimes cause the heart to beat very quickly. Medications that 
you were taking, such as theophylline, were likely contributing. 
Your heart rate was lowered using the same medication that you 
take at home, diltiazem, given through your IV. 

Your COPD was likely worsened because of a cold. However, your 
flare was very serious requiring IV steroids and many inhaled 
treatments. You should follow up with the lung doctors as ___ 
as with pulmonary rehab to make sure your lung disease is being 
treated as well as possible to prevent you from coming into the 
hospital as often. Please call ___ to schedule an 
appointment with them.

It was a pleasure participating in your care. We wish you all 
the best in the future.

Sincerely,

Your ___ team

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ is a ___ year old Male who presented on ___ for 
a planned minimally invasive and possibly open radical distal 
gastrectomy with lymphadenectomy for locally advanced gastric 
carcinoma after chemotherapy. After placement of the Right upper 
quadrant port, insufflation revealed the right upper quadrant 
port to be penetrating the omentum. It appeared to miss the 
transverse mesocolon as well as the colon itself. During the 
surgery, there were visually obvious peritoneal deposits on all 
peritoneal surfaces in all four quadrants, which demonstrated 
undetected carcinomatosis, poorly -differentiated adenocarcinoma 
involving the peritoneum. For this reason, the procedure was 
then aborted. Post-operatively the patient was taken to the PACU 
until stable and then transferred to the wards until stable to 
go home. 

#NEURO: The patient was alert and oriented throughout 
hospitalization; pain was initially managed with dilaudid PCA 
which he was not using and then transitioned to tramadol which 
he got only one dose. Pain was very well controlled.

#CV: The patient remained stable from a cardiovascular 
standpoint; vital signs were routinely monitored.  

#PULMONARY: The patient remained stable from a pulmonary 
standpoint; vital signs were routinely monitored. Good pulmonary 
toilet, early ambulation and incentive spirometry were 
encouraged throughout hospitalization.  

#GI/GU/FEN: Before the procedure started, OR nurse was unable to 
pass Foley after attempt with standard and coude type. PA 
___, with usual sterile technique, re-attempted foley 
placement after 10cc urojet application with ___ and ___ 
coude-type catheters but was also unable to get passed the 
prostate. Urology was consulted and they performed a flexible 
cystoscope demonstrating a normal urethra. Using a flexible 
guidewire, cystoscope was advanced into the bladder. The scope 
was withdrawn and a ___ council was advanced over the wire, 
passed the prostate and into the bladder. The patient was 
discharged with the Foley in place with instructions to 
follow-up with urology as outpatient in 5 to 7 days for a 
voiding trial. No antibiotics were administered. The patient was 
tolerating a regular diet prior to discharge. 

#ID: The patient's fever curves were closely watched for signs 
of infection, of which there were none.  

#HEME: Patient received BID SQH for DVT prophylaxis, in addition 
to encouraging early ambulation and Venodyne compression 
devices. On POD1 the patient was restarted on his home 
enoxaparin before discharge.

#TRANSITIONAL ISSUES
--------------------

At the time of discharge, the patient was doing well, afebrile 
with stable vital signs. The patient was tolerating diet as 
above per oral, ambulating, and pain was well controlled. The 
patient was discharged home with the Foley catheter with 
appropriate teaching for care. The patient received discharge 
teaching and follow-up instructions with understanding 
verbalized and agreement with the discharge plan.

you see your surgeon at your next visit. 
- You may start some light exercise when you feel comfortable. 
Slowly increase your activity back to your baseline as 
tolerated.
- Heavy exercise may be started after 6 weeks, but use common 
sense and go slowly at first. 
- No heavy lifting (10 pounds or more) until cleared by your 
surgeon, usually about 6 weeks. 
- You may resume sexual activity unless your doctor has told you 
otherwise.

HOW YOU MAY FEEL: 
- You may feel weak or ""washed out"" for 6 weeks. You might want 
to nap often. Simple tasks may exhaust you.
- You may have a sore throat because of a tube that was in your 
throat during the surgery.

YOUR BOWELS:
- Constipation is a common side effect of narcotic pain medicine 
such as oxycodone. If needed, you may take a stool softener 
(such as Colace, one capsule) or gentle laxative (such as milk 
of magnesia, 1 tbs) twice a day. You can get both of these 
medicines without a prescription.
- If you go 48 hours without a bowel movement, or have pain 
moving the bowels, call your surgeon.
- After some operations, diarrhea can occur. If you get 
diarrhea, don't take anti-diarrhea medicines. Drink plenty of 
fluids and see if it goes away. If it does not go away, or is 
severe and you feel ill, please call your surgeon.

PAIN MANAGEMENT:
- You are being discharged with a prescription for **oxycodone 
for pain control. You may take Tylenol as directed, not to 
exceed 3500mg in 24 hours. Take regularly for a few days after 
surgery but you may skip a dose or increase time between doses 
if you are not having pain until you no longer need it. You may 
take the oxycodone for moderate and severe pain not controlled 
by the Tylenol. You may take a stool softener while on narcotics 
to help prevent the constipation that they may cause. Slowly 
wean off these medications as tolerated. 
- Your pain should get better day by day. If you find the pain 
is getting worse instead of better, please contact your surgeon.

If you experience any of the following, please contact your 
surgeon: 
- sharp pain or any severe pain that lasts several hours
- chest pain, pressure, squeezing, or tightness
- cough, shortness of breath, wheezing
- pain that is getting worse over time or pain with fever
- shaking chills, fever of more than 101
- a drastic change in nature or quality of your pain
- nausea and vomiting, inability to tolerate fluids, food, or 
your medications
- if you are getting dehydrated (dry mouth, rapid heart beat, 
feeling dizzy or faint especially while standing)
-any change in your symptoms or any symptoms that concern you

Additional: 
*- pain that is getting worse over time, or going to your chest 
or back
*- urinary:  burning or blood in your urine or the inability to 
urinate

MEDICATIONS:
- Take all the medicines you were on before the operation just 
as you did before, unless you have been told differently.
- If you have any questions about what medicine to take or not 
to take, please call your surgeon. 

WOUND CARE: 
- dressing removal:
- You may remove your dressings tomorrow ___ and shower that 
same day with any bandage strips that may be covering your 
wound. Do not scrub and do not soak or swim, and pat the 
incision dry. If you have steri strips, they will fall off by 
themselves in ___ weeks. If any are still on in two weeks and 
the edges are curling up, you may carefully peel them off.
 Do not take baths, soak, or swim for 6 weeks after surgery 
unless told otherwise by your surgical team. 
-Notify your surgeon is you notice abnormal (foul smelling, 
bloody, pus, etc) or increased drainage from your incision site, 
opening of your incision, or increased pain or bruising. Watch 
for signs of infection such as redness, streaking of your skin, 
swelling, increased pain, or increased drainage. 

Please call with any questions or concerns. Thank you for 
allowing us to participate in your care. We hope you have a 
quick return to your usual life and activities.

Home with ___:
You had a Foley catheter in your bladder placed by urology on 
the day of your surgery after difficulty trying to place it.
You will keep the catheter until your appointment with Urology 
in 5 days (please call the number below to schedule your 
appointment), who will decide if you need it longer or attempt 
to remove it and see if you are able to void.
 Empty the bag as needed and as shown to you by nursing staff. 
You will be given a leg bag before your discharge, that you may 
use for short trips. This is a smaller bag that straps to your 
leg, to take home and wear if you are traveling outside your 
home. This holds a smaller amount than the bag you have now, so 
it needs to be emptied more often. Some people find it easier to 
use the larger bad when they are at home or carry it with them.

to stent ___, DES to ___, s/p 3 v CABG LIMA-LAD, 
SVG-OM1, SVG-D1(occluded) ___, HFpEF, IDDM, HTN who 
presented with several days atypical chest pain both with 
exertion and at rest, with mild T wave deepening but no other 
EKG changes or troponin. She also presented with mild DKA and 
diabetic foot ulcer. She had a stress test with reversible 
ischemia in the LAD territory (___) and went to cardiac 
catheterization ___ which showed stable disease and no new 
obstructive lesions. Overall her chest pain was felt to have 
been either musculoskeletal or demand in the setting of DKA and 
diabetic foot ulcer. She was discharged on ASA 81, atorvastatin 
80, Metoprolol XL 100mg daily. 

#DKA/IDDM: Patient presented with anion gap metabolic acidosis 
and felt to be in mild DKA. She had insulin gtt in the ED but 
was rapidly switched to subcutaneous insulin. Her A1c returned 
at 12%, which is the highest it has been recorded for her in our 
records. She had followed with ___ previously and was 
on canagliflozin and glipizide as well as SC insulin prior to 
admission. However, she reported intermittent adherence to her 
medications and this was the likely reason for her DKA. While 
she was in house the ___ followed along and she met 
with a diabetes educator. Her canagliflozin was stopped at 
discharge due to increased risk of amputation. 

#Diabetic foot ulcer: Present for at least 3 weeks prior to 
admission. She underwent bedside debridement by Podiatry in ED. 
XR suggested presence of osteomyelitis . She was maintained on 
vanc/cefepime/flagyl in house, and was switched to cipro/clinda 
at discharge per podiatry recs with plans for close follow up. 
Her wound swab at time of discharge was polymicrobial but was 
growing Group B strep (sensitivities pending) and klebsiella 
(pan sensitive). 

#Med noncompliance: She reported intermittent medication 
compliance related to difficulty remembering to take her 
medications as well as periods of depression and stress where 
taking her medication was not a priority. She has recently 
obtained a pillbox and her granddaughter is helping her with 
remembering to take her medications. 

#HFpEF: Metoprolol as above, continued torsemide 20mg and she 
appeared euvolemic throughout admission. 
#HL: Continued atorvastatin
#HTN: Metoprolol lowered to XL 100mg daily, losartan kept at 
25mg daily. Imdur stopped.
#COPD: Duonebs q6h in house, continued home inhalers on 
discharge. 
#Restless legs: continued ropinerole 

Transitional issues: 
- Please follow up her diabetic foot ulcer in ___ clinic. 
Plan at time of discharge was to take to OR for further surgical 
debridement, patient was discharged with cipro/clinda until 
Podiatry follow up 
- Please review her blood sugars at home and continue to 
reinforce compliance with diabetes medications. Her 
Canagliflozin was stopped due to increased risk of amputation. 
Consider reintroducing metformin as this was stopped ___ years ago 
for diarrhea but may be a better option for her. 
- Follow up blood pressures and heart rate on the current 
regimen. Suspect that due to noncompliance her medications were 
uptitrated to higher doses than she actually needs. We cut back 
her Metoprolol and stoped her imdur
- Can restart imdur if requiring for chest pain on outpatient 
basis
- Please continue to work with patient on med compliance and 
possible barriers. She denied depression with our social worker 
but does endorse that stress makes it hard to take her 
medications. 
- f/u final wound swab cultures

Please output the coding reason:<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
","I25110: Atherosclerotic heart disease of native coronary artery with unstable angina pectoris - Reason: The patient has a history of CAD with multiple stents and bypass grafts, and presented with atypical chest pain. Although the chest pain was ultimately felt to be non-cardiac, the underlying CAD and potential for unstable angina are documented.

E1110: Type 2 diabetes mellitus with ketoacidosis without coma - Reason: The patient presented with anion gap metabolic acidosis and was diagnosed with mild DKA, indicating active diabetic ketoacidosis.

E1122: Type 2 diabetes mellitus with diabetic chronic kidney disease - Reason: The patient has a history of diabetes and chronic kidney disease, as evidenced by elevated creatinine levels and anemia, which are common in patients with diabetic nephropathy.

E11319: Type 2 diabetes mellitus with unspecified diabetic retinopathy without macular edema - Reason: This code is not directly supported by the provided information. There is no mention of diabetic retinopathy in the medical record. This code might be incorrect or require additional documentation.

M869: Osteomyelitis, unspecified - Reason: X-ray of the foot suggested the presence of osteomyelitis, and the patient was treated with antibiotics for a diabetic foot ulcer.

I5032: Chronic diastolic (congestive) heart failure - Reason: The patient has a history of HFpEF (heart failure with preserved ejection fraction), which is a form of chronic diastolic heart failure.

I130: Hypertensive heart and chronic kidney disease with heart failure and stage 1 through stage 4 chronic kidney disease, or unspecified chronic kidney disease - Reason: The patient has hypertension, chronic kidney disease, and heart failure, which are all interrelated conditions often seen together in hypertensive heart disease.

Brief Hospital Course:
=============
SUMMARY
=============

___ yo F with hx of DMII, HTN who presented with diabetic foot 
ulcer on her left hallux complicated by osteomyelitis. She 
underwent surgical debridement and partial tissue and bone 
removal on ___. However the infection persisted, and she 
underwent left hallux amputation on ___. She was started 
on IV nafcillin for MSSA infection with plan to continue home 
infusions of nafcillin until at least ___

ACTIVE ISSUES
=============
#Osteomyelitis of left hallux: Due to diabetic ulcer of left 
hallux. Patient underwent partial left hallux amputation on ___ 
by podiatry. She was initially placed on IV Vancomycin, Flagyl, 
and cefepime. Initial surgical cultures came back positive for 
MSSA, so was changed to IV nafcillin. Patient continued to be 
afebrile, but her left foot continued to have erythema, edema, 
pain, and the ulcer was not healing well. There was concern for 
poor arterial blood flow and therefore underwent noninvasive 
arterial studies on bilateral lower extremities. The studies 
showed mild atherosclerotic disease in her left leg and foot, 
and severe atherosclerotic disease in her right leg and foot. 
Vascular surgery was consulted for potential intervention, but 
they felt that no further vascular intervention was warranted 
prior to podiatric surgery. The patient was brought back to the 
OR by podiatry on ___ for total left hallux amputation 
given lack of clinical improvement. Her ___ blood cell count 
continued to down trend. The pathology report showed clean 
margins. However, patient was continuing to have pain, and there 
was increased erythema and swelling around surgical site. An MRI 
of the left foot was done, which showed devitalization of the 
surgical flap, some edema, and a hyperintense focal spot at the 
site of the surgery. There were no signs of abscess or fluid 
collection. Podiatry team felt patient did not need any acute 
surgical intervention and will have close follow-up on 
___. A PICC line was placed in the right arm 
___ with tentative plan to complete a two-week course of IV 
nafcillin on ___. For the wound, podiatry recommends daily 
dressing changes to left foot surgical site: Betadine moistened 
gauze, 4x4 gauze, and kerlix.

#Cough: During her stay the patient developed cough that was 
nonproductive. It was thought to be due to atelectasis after 
surgery, especially since her rales on exam would clear with 
coughing. A repeat chest x-ray was negative for any acute 
cardiopulmonary processes and on comparison to previous chest 
x-ray during this hospital stay there were no changes. Will 
restart home Lasix at discharge.

#Hypertension: Patient's antihypertensives were held upon 
admission given that her blood pressures were low with systolic 
blood pressures in the ___ likely due to sepsis in the 
setting of her osteomyelitis from her diabetic foot ulcer. After 
her first debridement, patient's blood pressures increase to 
160s-170s so we restarted her losartan and furosemide. However 
her blood pressure dipped back down again to the ___ systolic 
and her creatinine bumped up to 1.8 so we discontinued her 
losartan and furosemide. Her metoprolol was continued with 
holding parameters, and it was held when her systolic blood 
pressure was less than 110. Her ___ resolved, and she became 
hypertensive again, so we restarted her losartan while in the 
hospital and instructed the patient to restart her Lasix upon 
discharge from the hospital.

#Acute Kidney Injury: Her baseline creatinine is 1.0. It bumped 
up to 1.8 in the setting of sepsis, restarting her losartan and 
furosemide, and hypotension. We gave her IV fluids and stopped 
her losartan and furosemide. Her creatinine continued to improve 
with these measures and upon discharge it was 1.1-1.2, which is 
around her baseline.

CHRONIC ISSUES
==============
#Diabetes Mellitus Type 2: Upon admission, patient was started 
on 80% of home insulin doses. Her Lantus inpatient dose was 32 
units, and her Humalog inpatient dose was 12 units 3 times 
daily. Patient's blood sugars were hard to control while she was 
inpatient. Working with the ___ diabetes consult team we 
adjusted her insulin doses as needed. ___ recommended 
discharging the patient on 48 units of Toujeo and 18 units of 
Novolog with meals as well as resuming her Trajenta and 
Jardiance.

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES
===================
[ ] Patient is on oxycodone 5 mg Q8H for her foot pain from the 
surgery. She was given enough to get her to her PCP appointment, 
which is ___. Please re-assess pain management.

[ ] Osteomyelitis, infected diabetic foot ulcer: Surgical margin 
from total left hallux amputation on ___ was negative for 
osteomyelitis. Patient to complete a 2 week course of nafcillin 
for ongoing soft tissue infection and will follow up with ID 
prior to completion of antibiotics to ensure resolution. Will be 
discharged on q4 hour nafcillin to be infused via a pump. Once 
finished an antibiotic should also have right arm PICC line 
removed. For the wound, podiatry recommends daily dressing 
changes to left foot surgical site: Betadine moistened gauze, 
4x4 gauze, and kerlix

[ ] Diabetes mellitus type 2: Patient's blood sugars were very 
labile. Given that she came in with a diabetic foot ulcer 
suggesting that her blood sugars are not well-controlled at 
home, she needs close follow-up to optimize her diabetic 
medication regimen. She is being discharged on reduced dose 
Toujeo and regular home Novolog along with her usual Trajenta 
and Jardiance with close follow-up with ___ provider on 
___, ___ at 1 ___. Please reassess patient's need for 
Jardiance given history of recurrent AKIs

[ ] Cough: Patient developed non-productive cough while in 
hospital but afebrile, no leukocytosis, CXR no signs of pleural 
effusion or consolidation. Suspect due to atelectasis in post-op 
period after foot surgery. Will discharge on incentive 
spirometer and restarting home Lasix as outpatient. If not 
improved once back on outpatient Lasix, would consider further 
workup.

[ ] Hypertension: Patient was discharged on her regular home 
medications. While she was an inpatient, she became hypotensive 
when we restarted her on all of her antihypertensives. Please 
follow her blood pressure to ensure that she is on the right 
regimen. If too low, might consider removing furosemide.

[ ] ___: Discharge creatinine 1.2 on ___. Suspect patient will 
have a slight bump in creatinine after restarting losartan on 
___. Patient had weekly labs checked with IV antibiotic 
infusions. If continues to rise, may be due to nafcillin and 
would consider switching antibiotic to cefazolin.

ECG ___ 8:33:29 ___
Baseline artifact. Sinus rhythm. Borderline P-R interval 
prolongation. Prominent voltage in leads I and aVL but does not 
meet criteria for left ventricular hypertrophy. There are marked 
ST segment depressions and T wave inversions in leads I, II, aVL 
and apical lateral leads. Compared to the previous tracing of 
___ the rate then was faster. ST-T wave abnormalities were 
similar. Consider left ventricular hypertrophy as before. 
Clinical correlation is suggested.

CXR ___
Patient is status post median sternotomy and CABG. Heart size is 
normal. Mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged. Pulmonary 
vasculature is normal. No focal consolidation, pleural effusion 
or pneumothorax is seen. No acute osseous abnormality is 
detected.
IMPRESSION: No acute cardiopulmonary abnormality.

Dipyridamole-MIBI Stress test ___
___ yp woman with HL, HTN, DM, PVD and diastolic CHF; s/p MI and 
multiple PCIs f/b CABG x 3 in ___ with known SVG-OM occlusion 
was referred to evaluate an atypical chest discomfort. The 
patient was administered 0.142 mg/kg/min of Persantine over 4 
minutes. Prior to the procedure the patient reported an isolated 
left-sided chest discomfort that had been present since 
admission and was tender to mild palpation; ___. This 
discomfort did not change in intensity during the procedure. In 
the presence of diffuse ST-T wave changes, no additional ECG 
changes were noted during the procedure. The hemodynamic 
response to the Persantine infusion was appropriate. 
Post-infusion, the patient was administered 125 mg Aminophylline 
IV.
IMPRESSION: Non-anginal type symptoms with no additional ST 
segment changes from baseline.
Imaging:
  Left ventricular cavity size is normal.
  Rest and stress perfusion images reveal uniform tracer uptake 
throughout the left ventricular myocardium.  The previously 
noted perfusion defect involving the inferolateral wall has 
resolved.
  Gated images reveal normal wall motion. The calculated left 
ventricular ejection fraction is 64%.
IMPRESSION: Normal myocardial perfusion study. Interval 
normalization of prior LCx territory perfusion defect.
 
Brief Hospital Course:
This is a ___ with type 2 diabetes mellitus on insulin, CAD s/p 
MI, S/P multiple PCIs and CABG ___ (LIMA-LAD, SVG-OM1; also 
SVG-D1 known occluded ___ with chronic stable angina 
admitted with atypical, stabbing, focal chest pain.

# Chest pain: Initially the patient was started on a heparin 
drip and other ACS protocol medications. Her home losartan and 
furosemide were held due to low blood pressures. Suspicion for 
cardiac etiology of chest pain was ultimately not high. She had 
an isolated ongoing ___ left-sided chest discomfort exacerbated 
by changes in position and with chest wall tenderness to light 
palpation. Despite prolonged chest pain, troponin-T and CK-MB 
negative x2 and EKGs mostly unchanged from prior. Given known 
H/O CAD, a vasodilator nuclear stress test was performed and was 
reassuring. Her discomfort did not change in intensity during 
the stress test drug infusion. In the presence of diffuse ST-T 
wave changes, no additional ECG changes were noted during the 
procedure. The hemodynamic response to the Persantine infusion 
was appropriate. Her perfusion study was normal with interval 
normalization of prior LCx territory perfusion defect. Given the 
stabbing quality and tenderness to palpation of the area of 
discomfort, her symptoms were most likely related to 
costochondritis or other musculoskeletal causes. She was started 
on aspirin 650 mg q6h with plans to trial for 2 days and 
continue through the week if symptoms improve.

Chronic medical problems:
# Diabetes mellitus: Continued levemir and was switched to a 
sliding scale of Humalog.
# Hypertension: Losartan was held as above due to hypotension 
and once daily isosorbide mononitrate was switched temporarily 
to isosorbide dinitrate TID. 
# For her hyperlipidemia, COPD and GERD, her home regimens were 
continued.  

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
- Patient had low blood pressures initially (88-92 systolic). 
Would benefit from close monitoring and titration of blood 
pressure medications as an outpatient
- She was hypokalemic (K 3.0) during admission (with ___ and 
furosemide already held). Please recheck CHEM-10 at ___ ___ 
visit on ___ to determine whether she might benefit from K 
supplementation
- Cr elevated to 1.2 on discharge (up from most recent 1.1.1). 
Please recheck at ___ office on ___

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___,
It was our pleasure participating in your care here at ___. 
You were admitted with severe chest pain. You underwent a stress 
test that showed the pain is unlikely from a big blockage in the 
arteries that feed your heart. Your lab work also did not 
suggest injury to the heart.

The pain you are experiencing is most likely musculoskeletal and 
should hopefully improve with supportive measures such as 
Tylenol (maximum 3 grams per day) and time. You will also be 
prescribed high dose aspirin (650mg). Please try this for two 
days and if there is improvement in your symptoms continue it 
for the week. 

If your symptoms worsen, you develop shortness of breath or any 
other concerning symptom, please let your doctor know right 
away.

Again, it was our pleasure participating in your care.

We wish you the very ___,

___ is a ___ y/o F with PMHx CHF, Afib not on 
anticoagulation, severe advanced Alzheimer's dementia, 
osteoporosis, HTN, who presents from assisted living facility 
with R hip pain, found to have DVT left common femoral vein with 
volume overload. During a meeting with patient and her family, 
decision was made to transition care to comfort-directed 
measures only and to pursue hospice services on discharge. 

ACTIVE ISSUES 
=============
# CMO. The team had a family meeting on ___ and decision was 
made to transition care to CMO and pursue 24 hour hospice 
services on discharge. Family did not want to pursue active 
treatments such as Lasix, which would make her uncomfortable 
given incontinence or shots such as lovenox for treatment of 
DVT. Home medications metoprolol, donepezil and Memantine were 
continued for comfort. She was discharged to an ___ 
___ facility. 

OTHER HOSPITAL ISSUES 
=====================

# DVT. Deep vein thrombosis of the left common femoral vein 
extending into at least the popliteal vein diagnosed on 
ultrasound on admission. This was likely acquired in the setting 
of immobility, as the patient had been restricted to her 
wheelchair at her assisted living for greater than 1 month due 
to deconditioning. She was initially started on Lovenox for 
treatment but this was discontinued in the setting of transition 
to care to CMO as above. 

# Acute CHF. Patient was volume overloaded on presentation with 
pleural effusions. She was diuresed with IV Lasix. Home 
metoprolol was continued at a decreased dose. In the setting of 
transition to care to CMO, Lasix was discontinued. She was 
continued on metoprolol for comfort. She remained on room air 
without respiratory distress.  

# Afib. She presented in sinus rhythm, rate controlled on 
metoprolol. Metoprolol was continued at a decreased dose for 
comfort. 

# Hip pain. The right hip pain that she presented with was 
resolved by the time of admission. Pelvic xray was without 
fracture. She was treated with Tylenol scheduled for pain 
control. 

# Al___ Dementia. She was AOx1 at her baseline per family 
members. She was continued on Aricept/Namenda.  

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES 
===================

- ___ facility to continue writing orders for 
pain/anxiety/secretions and other symptoms. 
- Continued metoprolol succinate and Memantine and donepezil on 
discharge for comfort. Continuation of these medications can be 
further decided at inpatient hospice. 
- MOLST form: DNR/DNI, do not re-hospitalize

depression, hyperlipidemia, antiphospholipid syndrome with hx
DVT/PE ___ ago on warfarin who presents for evaluation of severe
right lower extremity pain.

She was just admitted to the hospital for lumpectomy
(infiltrating ductal carcinoma of left breast) and sentinel 
lymph
node biopsy on ___, complicated by hematoma status post
evacuation on ___. Prior to these procedures, she had 
severe
right lower extremity pain similar to today and underwent a DVT
ultrasound on ___ which was negative. Her anticoagulation was
held in the hospital due to the hematoma, and she had DVT
prophylaxis with pneumoboots.

During her postoperative hematoma her anticoagulation was held.
She did not have extremity pain during her time in the hospital.
However, upon returning home, she developed severe pain which 
she
describes as cramps in her mid calf on the right. She also has
pain that intermittently occurs in the right thigh which she
describes as spasms. She has not had numbness, tingling, or
weakness on that side. She was seen in breast clinic today where
she complained of this pain, and was referred to the ED for
further evaluation. She initially triggered as a pulseless
extremity because of nonpalpable pulses in the right foot. She
has been taking Tylenol as well as tramadol with minimal pain
relief. 

Of note, she resumed her warfarin without any enoxaparin bridge
this past ___. She has been wearing compression stockings and
elevating her leg in an attempt to relieve the pain.

trochanteric
bursa and dystrophic calcification within the bursal space.  
Findings raise
suspicion for chronic trochanteric bursitis.
 
Brief Hospital Course:
SUMMARY:
==================
Ms. ___ is a ___ with a PMH significant for 
antiphospholipid syndrome with DVTs and PEs on Coumadin, recent 
L-sided breast cancer s/p lumpectomy, who presented to the ED 
with acute on chronic right lower extremity and right hip pain, 
making it difficult to ambulate. Right lower extremity U/S and 
CT did not reveal a DVT though calf veins were not well 
visualized. 

ACTIVE ISSUES:
==================
# Right trochanteric bursitis
# Right anterior lower leg pain
# Right sided varicose veins
Pt endorsed >4mths of pain in RLE that became acutely worse over 
the last few wks.  Her initial exam was most consistent with 
severe trochanteric bursitis on the right. She also has some 
focal pain along the right tibia which she felt was most 
consistent with pain from her varicose veins. The XRs of her 
tibia/fibula and right hip were without obvious pathology. There 
are no concerning neurologic symptoms to suggest a 
radiculopathy, no weakness or numbness though she may have some 
degree of chronic sciatica.  Mildly decreased patellar reflex on 
the right as compared to left may have been in the setting of 
pain and guarding; strength was normal bilaterally as was her 
sensation. 
She underwent U/S guided steroid injection of her trochanteric 
bursa w/ significant improvement in symptoms; ___ stated that 
there was some fluid near the bursa, suggestive of acute on 
chronic trochanteric bursitis. Her anterior shin pain improved 
with initiation of gabapentin and lidocaine patch in addition to 
her home tylenol and an increase in the frequency of her home 
tramadol (q8h PRN to q4h PRN).  Pt was not given her home 
hydromorphone PRN, though she did require one dose of 0.5 mg IV 
hydromorphone following her injection in the setting of an acute 
pain episode. She was discharged with Tramadol 50mg x15 tablets 
given increased requirement. By discharge, she was able ambulate 
and was felt safe for discharge home with a cane per ___ 
evaluation.  Pt was eager to leave and will reach out to her 
vascular surgeon for an appointment early in the new year for 
treatment of her painful varicose veins.

# Iron deficiency anemia:
Anemia is new since ___. Normocytic. Downtrended overnight to 
8.9 from 10.8. No concern for active bleeding. Per iron studies, 
she is iron deficient with a ferritin of 50. She endorses 
fatigue and restless leg syndrome. Etiology is unclear, though 
it may be related to the recent left breast hematoma of her 
breast (unlikely though the timing fits). Prior EGD with 
gastritis (___) for which she is on a BID PPI; prior 
colonoscopy ___ with findings that may be suggestive of 
celiac disease, though ttg at that time was normal with a normal 
IgA. She also had two polyps biopsied and were normal. On this 
admission, a vitamin D level was obtained to assess for evidence 
of malabsorption iso daily supplementation: level was 45. She 
was given ferric gluconate IV x1 on ___. TTG was repeated and 
pending at discharge. 

CHRONIC ISSUES:
===================
# History of DVT/PE on warfarin:
# Antiphospholipid antibody syndrome:
# Subtherapeutic INR:
Lupus anticoagulant positive in ___. She has been taking her 
home dose of warfarin (5 mg ___ and 7.5 mg other days). Her 
warfarin was held last ___ iso hematoma and she was not 
bridged with Lovenox upon reinitiation. INR on this admission 
was subtherapeutic at 1.4. Bridged during this hospitalization 
with Lovenox for goal INR ___. She was given an increased dose 
of warfarin, 7.5 mg daily while in house. INR at discharge was 
1.9, with plan to continue home warfarin regimen. Patient will 
get repeat INR on ___. 

# Vitamin D deficiency: pt takes 2,000 U vitamin D daily. Repeat 
level IS 45 which suggests against malabsorption to account for 
her iron deficiency. 

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
====================
Code status: Full, presumed
HCP: ___, granddaughter - ___.

- Right trochanteric bursitis:
[] Consider repeat injection
[] Consider physical therapy

- Right anterior leg pain
[] discharged on gabapentin 600 mg three times daily
[] discharged with tramadol 50mg, home regimen is Q8hrs and 
required Q4hrs during hospitalization. Will give two day supply 
of increased dose. Plan to see PCP next week.
[] Consider outpatient MRI of the lumbar spine for chronic pain 
[] Consider EMG
[] Vascular surgery follow up as outpt for treatment of painful 
veins

- Iron deficiency anemia:
[] Consider repeat IV iron infusion
[] F/u pending TTG
[] Consider further work up (though may be related to left 
breast hematoma)

- History of DVT/PE, antiphospholipid antibody syndrome, 
subtherapeutic INR:
[] F/u ___ clinic on ___. Patient can continue home 
Warfarin regimen

Discharge Instructions:
Dear ___, 

You were admitted because you were having a lot of leg pain, 
making it difficult to walk. 

In the hospital, we gave you a steroid injection near your right 
thigh for a condition called, Trochanteric Bursitis. We also 
gave you a medication called Gabapentin to help with your leg 
pain lower down. 

We also started you on a medication called Lovenox in order to 
bridge you back to your warfarin - currently, your warfarin dose 
is 7.5 mg daily and your INR was 1.9 at discharge (goal ___. 

Finally, you received 1 dose of intravenous iron because you are 
iron deficient which may be why you are more fatigued than 
usual.

When you go home, please take your medications as prescribed and 
make an appointment with your primary care doctor. We do not 
know what exactly is causing the lower leg pain, so you may want 
to talk to your doctor about having an MRI of your spine. You 
can also ask your doctor about prescribing a medication called 
DICLOFENAC GEL, also called VOLTAREN. This is essentially Motrin 
or Advil in a topical form and may help your pain.

Additionally, please talk to your doctor about why you may be 
iron deficient. 

It was a pleasure taking part in your care. We wish you all the 
best with your health.

Sincerely,
The team at ___

EXAMINATION:  CTA CHEST WITH CONTRAST  
COMPARISON:  Chest CT dated ___. 
  
FINDINGS:  
  
HEART AND VASCULATURE: There is no central pulmonary embolism.  
The thoracic 
aorta is normal in caliber without evidence of dissection or 
intramural 
hematoma.  The heart, pericardium, and great vessels are within 
normal limits. 
No pericardial effusion is seen. 
  
AXILLA, HILA, AND MEDIASTINUM: There is a 8.8 x 5.8 x 9.8 cm 
collection in the 
left breast, with density measuring 39 Hounsfield units, 
consistent with 
hematoma.  There are few foci of air within the collection, 
likely from prior 
aspiration, as well as few punctate hyperdensities at the 
periphery.  No 
axillary, mediastinal, or hilar lymphadenopathy is present.  The 
right axilla 
is not included on the study.  No mediastinal mass. 
  
PLEURAL SPACES: No pleural effusion or pneumothorax. 
  
LUNGS/AIRWAYS: Partially visualized lungs are clear without 
masses or areas of 
parenchymal opacification.  The airways are patent to the level 
of the 
segmental bronchi bilaterally. 
  
BASE OF NECK: Visualized portions of the base of the neck show 
no abnormality. 
  
BONES: No suspicious osseous abnormality is seen.? There is no 
acute fracture. 
  
IMPRESSION:  
  
8.8 x 5.8 x 9.8 cm left breast hematoma, with no evidence of 
active bleed.  
Please note, timing was suboptimal as the patient needed to be 
re-scanned due 
to incomplete field-of-view on initial images, however, the 
density of the 
collection was unchanged on all series.

Mucosa: Normal mucosa was noted in the rectum and sigmoid colon. 
 
Other No bleeding sources or blood identified, though extent of 
sigmoid colon evaluated was limited by poor prep.  
Impression: Normal mucosa in the rectum and sigmoid colon
No bleeding sources or blood identified, though extent of 
sigmoid colon evaluated was limited by poor prep.
Otherwise normal sigmoidoscopy to sigmoid colon at 25 cm 
Recommendations: If bleeding recurs, would recommend full 
colonoscopy with prep. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
This is an ___ year old female with past medical history of 
sjogrens, hemorrhoids, prior cdiff infection, admitted ___ 
with bright red blood per rectum thought to be acute lower GI 
bleed, subsequently stabilizing without intervention, status 
post flexible sigmoidoscopy without identifiable source, 
remaining stable x greater than 4 days, able to be discharged to 
rehab facility.

# Acute GI Bleed NOS - Patient presented with acute episode of 
BRBPR concerning for lower GI source.  Patient subsequently 
monitored without new or worsening anemia.  After discussion 
with family and patient regarding whether or not to further 
workup, they opted for flexible sigmoidoscopy (felt colonoscopy 
might be too invasive).  Patient underwent aborted flexible 
sigmoidoscopy on ___ due to pressence of copious stool in 
rectal vault, and then underwent successful flexible 
sigmoidoscopy on ___ without identifiable source for her 
bleeding.  From admission Hgb 9.8, discharge hemoglobin was 
10.5.  Per GI, could consider outpatient colonoscopy if 
consistent with patient's wishes.  

# Osteoporosis / chronic L1 compression fracture / 
deconditioning - patient with recent L1 compression fracture as 
outpatient prior to admission; patient noted to be significantly 
deconditioned this admission, requiring assistance with ADLs; 
patient seen by ___ and recommended for rehab.  Continued home 
Calcium 500 + vitamin D, calcitonin.  Placed on Tylenol and 
tramadol for pain control with good effect 

# Chronic Severe Protein Calorie Malnutrition - per discussion 
with family and review of chart, patient has lost weight despite 
PEG placement and bolus tube feeds (has had difficulty 
maintaining PO intake due to her Sjogrens).  At home patient has 
not be using full recommended 2 cans of Nutren 2.0, 500 
Cal/250ml BID.  Here patient seen by nutrition, continued on 
above 2 cans, and was given oral supplementation with her PO 
meals as well.   

# Depression - continued home BuPROPion and mirtazapine 

# Hypothryoidism - continued levothyroxine 

Transitional Issues
- Code status - DNR/DNI
- Discharged to rehab
- No source for bleeding identified this admission; can consider 
future colonoscopy to look for source of bleeding, but would 
first discuss if consistent with patient's goals of care
- Would consider encouragement of PO intake and PEG-tube 
supplementation given her malnutrition

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ is an ___ year old gentleman with history of CAD 
(s/p CABG and PCI), pAF, PAH, diastolic CHF who presents with 
weight gain, leg swelling and new evidence of right ventricle 
dilation concerning for acute on chronic heart failure 
exacerbation.  

#Acute on Chronic Diastolic Heart Failure Exacerbation: with 
component of RV failure by report of OSH echo.  Likely primary 
process is lung disease causing elevated RV pressures and 
subsequent poor filling of LV.  He diuresed quite well with 20 
IV Lasix which is consistent with RV failure.  Started on 
torsemide 10 daily but this is likely too aggressive.  We 
obtained an echo but read PND at time of discharge.  We sent him 
home on a diuretic regimen on torsemide 5 mg daily (and 
discontinued home triamterene-HCTZ).  Close follow up with Dr. 
___ ensured.

#Elevated Transaminases:  Patient with mildly elevated AST and 
ALT. Most likely etiologies in this patient include amiodarone 
toxicity and congestive hepatopathy.  Encouraged outpatient 
trending. 

#Pulmonary disease: patient with extensive emphysema on CTA 
though patient has no history of smoking.  As this may be 
driving R heart failure, Dr. ___ requested pulmonology 
consult prior to discharge but patient was insistent on leaving. 
 Instead scheduled outpatient appointment. 
 
#Atrial Fibrillation: Continue home amiodarone 200mg daily, 
Apixaban 5mg BID  

#CAD: Continue ASA 81mg, rosuvastatin 40mg qHS  

#HTN: continue home losartan 25mg qD.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___,

You were hospitalized for progressive leg swelling over the past 
week and a half.  We started you on a new medication here that 
should help prevent this from happening.  Of note, Dr. ___ was 
concerned about a clot in your lungs, but our scans showed NO 
clot.  With this news, you were discharged home with PCP and 
cardiology follow up.

Please continue to take your torsemide in order to maintain your 
weight. Please weight yourself everyday and call your 
cardiologist if you weight changes by three pounds.

You also have ""pulmonary hypertension,"" which may be due to your 
underlying lung disease. Amiodarone can also cause lung changes 
and we recommend following up with the lung doctors as ___ 
outpatient to see if this may be contributing. 

It was a pleasure taking care of you!

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Dyspnea on Exertion
HISTORY OF PRESENTING ILLNESS:  
Mr. ___ is a ___ gentleman with a past medical
history pertinent for HFrEF (35% ___ CAD s/p CABG and
subsequent PCI, moderate tricuspid regurgitation, right
ventricular dysfunction, moderate pulmonary hypertension, and
paroxysmal atrial fibrillation on apixaban, stage III chronic
kidney disease (Baseline Cr 2.0-2.1), cerebrovascular disease,
and metastatic melanoma of unknown primary on checkpoint
inhibitor pembrolizumab who was found volume overloaded with
increased DOE, admitted to ___ for IV diuresis. 

Per most recent outpatient CHF notes:

He was seen by his primary car primary Cardiologist, Dr. ___ increased fatigue and exertional dyspnea. Dr. ___ 
a
___ and felt his LVEF was ~30% and reduced from prior. He was
started on low-dose Entresto, but couldn't tolerate it from a BP
prospective. He was previously on losartan which was stopped
due to this lightheadedness, dizziness and worsening renal
function. Dr. ___ concern about the possibility of
myocarditis secondary to the checkpoint inhibitor. When he
followed up with the Oncology team on ___, his symptoms were
somewhat improved. Cardiac biomarkers were notable for a rising
NTproBNP to >10K but normal CK-MB and minimally elevated 
troponin
T of 0.03, which is not unexpected in the setting
of decompensated ___ failure and chronic kidney disease. He 
was
planned to receive immunotherapy on ___, but treatment was
held due to elevated Cr. Recheck showed improvement. The patient
restarted pembrolizumab on ___. Pembrolizumab was again 
held
in ___ for diarrhea and elevated LFTs 

In addition, he also received intravenous hydration.
Subsequently, he was noted to be more volume overloaded, at 
which
time Torsemide from 20 mg daily to 30 mg daily then 40 mg daily.
Troponin testing showed Trop-T of 0.04, attributed to renal
insufficiency. The patient was also noted to have mild
hyperkalemia (K 5.7) for which potassium supplementation was
stopped and torsemide dose increased. He was also seen in the
Emergency room in the ___ ___ due to a
fall with resultant scalp laceration. CT head and neck was
unremarkable. 

He presented this morning ___ for his scheduled visit at
___ clinic where he noted that his weight had been 126 lbs most
recently on his home scale. He also reported decreased appetite
that he attributes to eating a different diet. He currently has 
a
___ care taker that makes ___ food for him, adhering
to a low sodium diet, that he does not like as much as his
regular diet. He drinks ___ glasses of water or juice daily. He
was taking torsemide 40 mg daily, that he decreased to 30 mg
daily several days ago as he felt he was urinating too
frequently. He also ran out of tamsulosin several days ago so
stopped taking this around the same time. He noted becoming 
short
of breath after taking 20 steps or less. Due to his volume
overloaded noted on exam he was recommended for admission to ___
for IV diuresis

On the floor, he endorses the above history. He noted that his
SOB has progressive gotten worse. Mostly occurs with activity.
None at rest. He noted that his weight has been slowly 
decreasing
due lack of appetite and him being to lazy. He has a home health
aid everyday from 11am-7pm, who helps him with ADL.  He endorses
abdominal bloading. 

Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, palpitations, syncope,
or presyncope.

ROS otherwise negative, unless otherwise noted above

PATIENT SUMMARY: 
==================== 
Mr. ___ is a ___ gentleman with PMHx of CAD s/p 
CABG
and subsequent PCI, HFrEF (35% ___, moderate tricuspid
regurgitation, right ventricular dysfunction, moderate pulmonary
hypertension, and paroxysmal atrial fibrillation on apixaban,
stage III chronic kidney disease (Baseline Cr 2.0-2.1),
cerebrovascular disease, and metastatic melanoma of unknown
primary on checkpoint inhibitor pembrolizumab who was found
volume overloaded with increased DOE, admitted to acute ___ 
failure for IV diuresis, now transitioned to oral duiretics. 

# CORONARIES: Left Main and two vessel coronary disease (___).
# PUMP: 35% ___ 
# RHYTHM: Ectopic rhythm, PR prolongation, left axis deviation, 
RBBB

ACTIVE ISSUES: 
============== 
# ___ Failure with reduced ejection fraction
# Right ventricular dysfunction, TR, pulm HTN
# Volume overload
His ___ failure exacerbation is likely secondary to his recent
administration of IV fluids in addition to his self down
titration of his torsemide over the last week. In addition, he
does not follow a restricted fluid intake and drinks ___ glasses
of water or juice daily. Furthermore, he has not tolerated
guideline directed medical therapy due to recurrent issues with
acute kidney injury and elevated transaminitis while on
pembrolizumab therapy. He was clinically volume overloaded with
elevated BNP 16020. We initiated IV lasix 160 bolus and put him 
on a lasix gtt with good response, however he his Cr increased 
from 2.1-->2.7. His Cr. improved with transition to PO Torsemide 
40 mg daily. We monitored and aggressively repleted his 
potassium. No afterload reduction or neural hormonal blockade 
was added.

# Chronic Kidney Disease: Baseline 2.1-2.3 . 
Cr 2.1 on admission(Stable )- Cr on discharge:2.2
Cr initially uptrended above baseline from 2.1---> 2.7. Felt 
likely due to increased diuretic usage as it improved with 
stopping diuretics. Less likely cardiorenal syndrome. In 
addition,patient was recently seen in follow-up by nephrology. 
They felt his CKD was less likely to be related to pembrolizumab 
and more likely related to age-related decline in renal 
function. Creatinine 2.2 on discharge (stable).

# Metastatic Melanoma 
He is followed by Dr. ___. He was previously on
Pembrolizumab which was held due diarrhea, elevated LFTs and
worsening kidney function. Negative troponin and CK MB, no 
concern
for drug-induced myocarditis at this point. Followup in 
___ clinic in 2weeks after discharge

# Elevated transaminiatis
Stable. Statin and ___ had previously been held. No changes made 
during admission. 

# Urinary frequency
Likely due to diuretic use. Afebrile and asx otherwise
-Continued home tamsulosin

# Coronary artery disease, s/p CABG and LAD PCI.
-Continued aspirin 81 mg daily
-Statin stopped prior to admission due to elevated LFTs. 
Continued holding. 

CHRONIC ISSUES: 
============== 

# Paroxysmal Atrial fibrillation
Rythym: Continue amiodarone 200mg for rhythm control strategy
(monitoring safety labs)
-Continued anticoagulation with apixaban 2.5mg twice daily

# Hypertension: Stable.

SUMMARY:
===============
Mr. ___ is a ___ man with PMH of HFrEF (35% 
___,
CAD s/p 3v CABG (___) and subsequent PCI to the LAD (___),
moderate tricuspid regurgitation, right ventricular dysfunction,
moderate pulmonary hypertension, and paroxysmal atrial 
fibrillation on apixaban, stage III chronic kidney disease 
(Baseline Cr 2.0-2.1), cerebrovascular disease, and metastatic 
melanoma of unknown primary on Pembrolizumab (on hold since 
___ iso worsening transaminitis and concern for 
cardiotoxicity). He was admitted with volume overload from heart 
failure exacerbation and pneumonia with high oxygen 
requirements. He initially required CCU admission for high flow 
oxygen, weaned to nasal cannula after aggressive IV diuresis and 
treatment of pneumonia with 5 day course of Zosyn after 
receiving vancomycin at OSH. He was transferred to cardiology 
floor where he continued to diurese well and his oxygen 
requirement was weaned to ___. He was transitioned to 60 mg 
torsemide PO BID which adequately maintained euvolemia. 

ACUTE ISSUES: 
============= 
# Acute on chronic systolic heart failure exacerbation
Patient with history of heart failure with etiology likely 
ischemic cardiomyopathy given history of CAD s/p CABG and PCI. 
Admitted with fluid overload and pleural effusion. Trigger for 
current exacerbation could be infectious given evidence of 
pneumonia in left lower lobe on admission. Patient with high 
oxygen requirements prior to admission but responded 
appropriately to diuresis with Lasix. After IV diuresis, patient 
was transitioned PO torsemide and maintained at euvolemia. With 
effective diuresis, the patient's oxygen requirement gradually 
lowered from 4L NC to ___ NC. He was discharged on torsemide 60 
mg PO BID. He was unable to tolerate afterload reducing agents 
or neurohormonal blockade agents due to hypotension. 

# Lower left lobe pneumonia
Patient with evidence of pneumonia in the left lower lobe, 
received vanc/zosyn at outside hospital and continued on Zosyn 
here for a total of 5 day course with resolution of symptoms. We 
suspect that his lingering O2 requirement is at least in part 
due to slowly resorbing consolidation left over from his 
infection. He was requiring ___ of supplemental O2 by NC at 
time of discharge.

# Pleural effusion, bilateral
Patient with evidence of right pleural effusion. Etiology likely 
fluid overload given heart failure with reduced ejection 
fraction. Pleural effusion resolved improved with diuresis and 
his oxygen requirement trended down to ___ NC. Given this, 
thoracentesis was deferred. 

# Atrial fibrillation
Patient with chronic history of atrial fibrillation. In afib 
throughout this admission. Continued amiodarone and apixaban. 
Rates appropriately controlled.

CHRONIC ISSUES
================
# Coronary artery disease s/p CABG
Patient with history of 3 vessel CABG on ___ (___) and
subsequent PCI to LAD (___). Continued home aspirin. Patient 
was started on low dose rosuvastatin 5 mg daily. On review, it 
appears he had been on this medication at this dose in the past 
but it was discontinued due to transamnitis; however, at the 
time it was unclear whether this was an effect of the statin or 
pembrolizumab. Given that the patient has not had his checkpoint 
inhibitor therapy since ___, the decision was to restart 
rosuvastatin. 

# Chronic kidney disease
Baseline Cr appears to be 2.1-2.2 over past year. Cr remained 
between 1.8-2.4 throughout admission. 

# Anemia
Chronic, although worsening since ___. On admission 
hemoglobin
10.6 and remained stable. 

# Thrombocytopenia
Uncertain etiology, appears subacute/chronic. On admission
platelets 130 down-trended to 100s. No concern for bleeding 
throughout admission. 

# Melanoma

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___,
It was a pleasure taking care of you here at ___ 
___. You were admitted to our hospital 
after undergoing repair of your inguinal hernia. You have 
recovered from surgery and are now ready to be discharged home. 
Please follow the recommendations below to ensure a speedy and 
uneventful recovery. 
 
ACTIVITY:
- Do not drive until you have stopped taking pain medicine and 
feel you could respond in an emergency.
- You may climb stairs. 
- You may go outside, but avoid traveling long distances until 
you see your surgeon at your next visit.
- Don't lift more than 10 lbs for 6 weeks. (This is about the 
weight of a briefcase or a bag of groceries.) This applies to 
lifting children, but they may sit on your lap.
- You may start some light exercise when you feel comfortable.
- You will need to stay out of bathtubs or swimming pools for a 
time while your incision is healing. Ask your doctor when you 
can resume tub baths or swimming.
- Heavy exercise may be started after 6 weeks, but use common 
sense and go slowly at first.
- You may resume sexual activity unless your doctor has told you 
otherwise.
 
HOW YOU MAY FEEL: 
- You may feel weak or ""washed out"" for 6 weeks. You might want 
to nap often. Simple tasks may exhaust you.
- You may have a sore throat because of a tube that was in your 
throat during surgery.
- You might have trouble concentrating or difficulty sleeping. 
You might feel somewhat depressed.
- You could have a poor appetite for a while. Food may seem 
unappealing.
- All of these feelings and reactions are normal and should go 
away in a short time. If they do not, tell your surgeon.
 
YOUR INCISION:
- Your incision may be slightly red around the edges. This is 
normal.
- If you have steri strips, do not remove them for 2 weeks. 
(These are the thin paper strips that are on your incision.) But 
if they fall off before that that's okay).
- You may gently wash away dried material around your incision.
- It is normal to feel a firm ridge along the incision. This 
will go away.
- Avoid direct sun exposure to the incision area.
- Do not use any ointments on the incision unless you were told 
otherwise.
- You may see a small amount of clear or light red fluid 
staining your dressing or clothes. If the staining is severe, 
please call your surgeon.
- You may shower. As noted above, ask your doctor when you may 
resume tub baths or swimming.
- Over the next ___ months, your incision will fade and become 
less prominent.
 
YOUR BOWELS:
- Constipation is a common side effect of medicine such as 
Percocet or codeine. If needed, you may take a stool softener 
(such as Colace, one capsule) or gentle laxative (such as milk 
of magnesia, 1 tbs) twice a day. You can get both of these 
medicines without a prescription.
- If you go 48 hours without a bowel movement, or have pain 
moving your bowels, call your surgeon.
- After some operations, diarrhea can occur. If you get 
diarrhea, don't take anti-diarrhea medicines. Drink plenty of 
fluids and see if it goes away. If it does not go away, or is 
severe and you feel ill, please call your surgeon.
 
PAIN MANAGEMENT:
- It is normal to feel some discomfort/pain following abdominal 
surgery. This pain is often described as ""soreness"". 
- Your pain should get better day by day. If you find the pain 
is getting worse instead of better, please contact your surgeon.
-You will receive a prescription from your surgeon for pain 
medicine to take by mouth. It is important to take this medicine 
as directed. 
- Do not take it more frequently than prescribed. Do not take 
more medicine at one time than prescribed.
- Your pain medicine will work better if you take it before your 
pain gets too severe. 
- If you are experiencing no pain, it is okay to skip a dose of 
pain medicine.
If you experience any of the folloiwng, please contact your 
surgeon:
- sharp pain or any severe pain that lasts several hours
- pain that is getting worse over time
- pain accompanied by fever of more than 101
- a drastic change in nature or quality of your pain
 
MEDICATIONS:
- Take all the medicines you were on before the operation just 
as you did before, unless you have been told differently.
- If you have any questions about what medicine to take or not 
to take, please call your surgeon.

History of Present Illness:
 HISTORY OF PRESENTING ILLNESS: Mr. ___ is a ___
male with rheumatoid arthritis, DMARD holiday, and recent, brief
hospitalization for presumptive pericarditis, returned to 
outside
hospital with probable cardiac tamponade now post-bedside
pericardiocentesis with drain placement prior to transfer.
Importantly, patient was hospitalized at ___ on ___ with acute pleuritic chest pain of two-day duration in the
context of constellation of fatigue, malaise, upper respiratory
symptoms, and non-productive cough. While CTA exonerated
pulmonary embolism, thickened pericardium and small effusion 
were
noted, suggesting pericarditis. ECG revealed subtle diffuse ST
elevations in keeping with pericarditis. Echocardiogram 
confirmed
said effusion, though no features of tamponade were appreciated.
He was discharged the same day with ibuprofen 600 mg TID and
colchicine 0.6 mg BID. He had persistence of minor residual 
chest
pain, which began to worsen two days later, but was tolerable
until yesterday evening when it evolved to severe, unrelenting
pain across his precordium likened to ""wearing shoulder pads
bearing down on him."" He notes a new concurrent substernal chest
pain that ""goes straight to his back."" He then became dyspneic,
prompting him to seek care. He arrived at ___ hypotensive
with SBP in the 80-range. He was borderline tachycardic and in
mild respiratory distress, but oxygenation was acceptable. He
rapidly received three liters of fluid for presumptive tamponade
within the confines of poor windows on bedside echocardiogram.
Pericardiocentesis yielded 400 cc or more of serous fluid and a
pericardial drain was placed. Hemodynamics rapidly improved. On
arrival to ___ ED, patient was indeed hemodynamically stable
but was then in moderate respiratory distress, requiring
non-rebreather. He was given Lasix 20 mg IV. Bedside
echocardiogram was limited, but preliminarily suggestive of 
small
residual effusion. In the CCU, patient notes resurgence of said
chest pain. His dyspnea is improving. An additional 250 cc was
drained.

Brief Hospital Course:
SUMMARY: 
===================== 
___ male with rheumatoid arthritis, DMARD holiday, and
recent, brief hospitalization for presumptive pericarditis,
returned to outside hospital with pericardial effusion with 
possible tamponade physiology now post-bedside 
pericardiocentesis prior to transfer, with persistent 
pericardial effusion now s/p drain placement with course 
complicated by acute hypercapneic respiratory distress. 

#CORONARIES: unknown.
#PUMP: normal biventricular structure and function. 
#RHYTHM: NSR. pAF ___

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
====================
[] He was discharged on ibuprofen 600mg TID and colchicine 0.6mg 
BID for his inflammatory pericarditis. He should continue 
colchicine for 3 months. He should have his ibuprofen tapered 
weekly following resolution of his symptoms over 3 weeks to 
reduce the risk of recurrence. 
[] He was discharged on a PPI and should continue this while on 
ibuprofen. 
[] Strongly recommend that patient receive outpatient PFTs given 
high suspicion for baseline obstructive/restrictive pulmonary 
disease 
[] Patient developed paroxysmal afib with RVR during this 
admission which is a new diagnosis. CHADSVASC 2 for hypertension 
and diabetes. Anticoagulation was not started during this 
admission given that he was felt to have relatively low risk for 
CVA, however please make a note of this new diagnosis and 
reassess need for anticoagulation as medically appropriate. 
[] He was newly diagnosed with DM (HbA1c 7.9 at ___ 
and will be discharged on metformin 500 BID. Will require 
outpatient follow-up for this and can consider uptitration in 
the outpatient setting. 
[] Please reassess need for diuretic in the outpatient setting. 
He had no echocardiographic evidence of heart failure during 
this admission so was not discharged on diuretics. 

New medications:
Metformin 500mg BID
Metoprolol XL 50mg QD 
Omeprazole 20mg QD 

Continued medications:
Atorvastatin 10mg QPM
Colchicine 0.6mg BID
Ibuprofen 600mg TID
Folic acid 1mg PO QD
Sertraline 100mg PO QD

Stopped medications: 
Methotrexate 20mg PO
Famotidine 20mg QD

ACUTE ISSUES: 
=============
#) Acute pericarditis
#) Cardiac tamponade, now s/p pericardiocentesis and drain
placement 
He presented with inflammatory pericarditis of probable viral 
nature in the context of viral-like prodrome versus rheumatic 
pericarditis, given serologic positive active disease in the 
absence of DMARD. Pericardial fluid cultures from ___ 
negative, cultures here with 1 colony on 1 plate of coag 
negative staph felt to be contaminant, negative acid fast smear. 
No biochemical evidence of myocardial injury on admission, 
unlikely to have concurrent myocarditis or cardiac event 
sequelae. At ___ was initially noted to have SBPs in 
the ___ and received fluid resuscitation and pericardiocentesis 
given concern for tamponade physiology. Hemodynamics 
subsequently stabilized and remained so throughout the duration 
of his admission here. TTE on ___ showed no pericardial 
effusion. Pericardial drain was initially left to gravity due to 
continued output, and was removed ___. He was treated with 
colchicine 0.6mg BID which he will continue for 3 months after 
discharge. He also received ibuprofen 600mg PO TID and will be 
discharged on a slow taper; he received PPI while receiving 
NSAIDs. 

#) Acute hypercapnic respiratory failure - resolving
Probable flash pulmonary edema from rapid large-volume fluid 
administration on tamponade, as evidenced by radiographic 
pulmonary edema. Earlier echocardiogram otherwise not suggestive 
of ventricular dysfunction and BNP is within normal limits. TTE 
on ___ was without evidence of cardiac etiology for his 
pulmonary edema/respiratory failure.
Patient likely has unappreciated restrictive pulmonary 
physiology. Additionally, no emphysematous changes noted on CT 
one week ago, but
background obstructive defect is conceivable, given compelling
smoking history. He had a negative CTA one week prior to 
admission. Patient had leukocytosis on admission without clear 
radiographic consolidation suggestive of pneumonia - one dose of 
empiric azithromycin was given overnight and discontinued on 
___. He received IV diuresis with significant improvement in 
his respiratory status. O2 weaned ___ morning. He was breathing 
comfortably on RA at the time of discharge with ambulatory 
saturations >90%. 

#) Paroxysmal AFib, new diagnosis 
Patient went into Afib with RVR on ___, and subsequently 
received metoprolol. He subsequently flipped back into NSR. His 
CHADsVASC = 2 (DM, HTN). Anticoagulation was discussed but 
ultimately deferred at the time of discharge given the patient's 
lower overall risk for CVA and concerns regarding medication 
adherence/cost. He was discharged on metoprolol. He should have 
his need for anticoagulation reassessed as an outpatient as 
medically appropriate. 

#) Type II diabetes: 
He was newly diagnosed with DM with a A1C of 7.9% during this 
admission. He was maintained on an insulin sliding scale during 
this admission and will be discharged on metformin 500mg BID. 

CHRONIC/STABLE ISSUES:
====================
#) Rheumatoid arthritis: 
RF and anti-CCP positive per outpatient rheumatology. Not
currently endorsing sx suggestive of RA flare. Per discussion
with OP rheumatologist, deferred restarting MTX and/or other
DMARD until outpatient.

#) HTN
His home BP meds were held initially due to soft BPs and were 
stopped at the time of discharge as he remained normotensive.

","I309:Acute pericarditis, unspecified - The patient presented with acute pericarditis, which was initially diagnosed and treated with ibuprofen and colchicine. The condition was confirmed through clinical examination and imaging studies, including ECG and echocardiogram, which showed findings consistent with pericarditis.

J9602:Acute respiratory failure with hypercapnia - The patient developed acute hypercapnic respiratory failure, likely secondary to flash pulmonary edema following rapid large-volume fluid administration. This was evident from the patient's respiratory distress, elevated carbon dioxide levels, and the need for supplemental oxygen.

I314:Cardiac tamponade - The patient experienced symptoms and signs of cardiac tamponade, including hypotension and borderline tachycardia. This was confirmed by bedside echocardiography and managed with pericardiocentesis, which yielded a significant amount of fluid and led to rapid hemodynamic improvement.

I480:Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation - The patient developed paroxysmal atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response during the hospital stay. This was managed with metoprolol, and the patient reverted to normal sinus rhythm.

E119:Type 2 diabetes mellitus without complications - The patient was newly diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus based on an HbA1c level of 7.9% and was started on metformin.

Z66:Do not resuscitate - The patient has a documented do-not-resuscitate (DNR) order, indicating his preference for end-of-life care.

I10:Essential (primary) hypertension - The patient has a history of essential hypertension, which is mentioned in the past medical history section.

TTE ___:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. The estimated right atrial 
pressure is ___ mmHg. Left ventricular wall thicknesses and 
cavity size are normal. Overall left ventricular systolic 
function is moderately depressed (LVEF= ? 35-40% - assessment 
limited by suboptimal image quality and significant beat to beat 
variability). There is hypokinesis of the mid-distal LV segments 
and apex. There is no ventricular septal defect. Right 
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The 
ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The number of aortic valve 
leaflets cannot be determined. There is mild aortic valve 
stenosis (valve area 1.2-1.9cm2). No aortic regurgitation is 
seen. The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial 
mitral regurgitation. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure 
could not be determined. There is a trivial/physiologic 
pericardial effusion. 

Compared with the prior focused study (images reviewed) of 
___, left ventricular systolic function is probably 
similar, although suboptimal image quality of both studies 
precludes definite comparison.  

___ CXR
 
IMPRESSION:  
  
Generalized improvement in both lungs is probably due to 
decrease in pulmonary 
edema, now mild, and decrease in previous moderate right pleural 
effusion.  
There is still substantial consolidation in the right upper lobe 
probably 
pneumonia but the bilateral lower lobe components have improved. 
 Heart size 
top-normal.  No pneumothorax.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ is a ___ M w/ HTN, HLD, DMII, and old MI transferred 
from ___ w/ NSTEMI w/ diffuse 3 vessel disease s/p DES to 
mid-LAD occlusion found to have severe Cdiff.

ACTIVE ISSUES
==============
# NSTEMI 
NSTEMI based on STE aVR and V1 but o/w ST depressions w/ 
significant multi vessel disease but significant stenosis in LAD 
s/p DES that occluded diagnonal. Repeat cath unchanged. He was 
started on plavix, atorvastatin, ACE-I, and metoprolol. Echo 
showed LVEF 35-40% with hypokinesis of mid-distal LV segments 
and apex. He was started on warfarin for his hypokinetic LV as 
well as his atrial fibrillation as discussed below.

# ___
Possibly mixed cardiogenic/distributive given mixed venous O2 
65%, CI 2.1, PCWP 25. He initially required pressors and balloon 
pump and was then successfully weaned off both. He remained 
hemodynamically stable during rest of hospital course. 

# Atrial Fibrillation
Patient with a reported history of paroxysmal afib per his PCP 
for which he was maintained on digoxin as well as aspirin 325mg 
PO daily prior to admission.  He was found to be in atrial 
fibrillation during admission and the decision was made to 
anticoagulate with Coumadin.  He was continued on home dose 
digoxin.  His home dose aspirin was decreased as discussed above 
with initiation of Coumadin.

# Hematuria: 
Likely traumatic in setting of systemic anticoagulation, as 
patient pulled at ___. Cytology was negative. He will followup 
outpatient with urology.

# Dyspnea: 
Patient had acute episodes of dyspnea.  This was mainly 
attributed to pulmonary edema and improved with diruesis.  
Additionally, CXR showed possible consolidation of RUL, 
concerning for aspiration pneumonia. However, treatment was 
deferred as he had no other focal signs of infectious pna.  He 
did have sputum cultures which grew Klebsiella pneumonia but on 
discussion with ID, felt this did not warrant any treatment as 
he was asymptomatic.  He was discharged on po lasix 20 mg daily 
with next electrolytes to be checked ___. 
 
# C diff, severe: 
Had loose stool in setting of antibiotic tx for Hpylori 
(initiated outpatient). Given WBC >15, ___, age >___ treated as 
severe. Patient was started on vancomycin 125mg PO qid for 14 
day course (day ___, last day ___. 
 
# GASTROESOPHAGEAL REFLUX DISEASE (GERD): 
Endoscopy confirmed H Pylori treated with PPI + 
clarithromycin/amoxicillin since ___ for 14 days. Omeprazole 
was continued. Antibiotics held in setting of c.diff infection. 

# Delirium: 
Patient with frequent sundowning during hospitalization 
requiring Seroquel po.

CHRONIC ISSUES
===============
# Spinal Stenosis: Continued gabapentin, d/ced naproxen.  Did 
not complain of pain throughout hospital course.  Explained he 
should not take any more NSAIDS in setting of recent ACS and now 
on Coumadin, Plavix and asa. 
# DM: maintained on ISS during admission and discharged on home 
glipizide and metformin
# HTN: Home dose metoprolol uptitrated.  Home dose lisinopril 
decreased.  Home dose imdur discontinued.
# HLD: Transitioned home dose simvastatin to atorvastatin

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES
=====================
- Discharge weight: 63.7kg 
- patient will require urology followup given hematuria during 
admission.  Urine cytology negative.

","I214: The patient presented with NSTEMI (Non-ST elevation myocardial infarction) which was confirmed through EKG findings, elevated troponin levels, and subsequent cardiac catheterization revealing significant coronary artery disease.
R570: Cardiogenic shock is coded based on the clinical presentation of hypotension, use of pressors and intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP), and the overall hemodynamic instability requiring intensive monitoring and intervention.
I509: Unspecified heart failure is coded due to the reduced LVEF (left ventricular ejection fraction) of 35-40% and the presence of symptoms like dyspnea and pulmonary edema.
R578: Other shock is coded to capture the distributive component of the shock, given the mixed venous oxygen saturation of 65%, CI (cardiac index) of 2.1, and PCWP (pulmonary capillary wedge pressure) of 25.
A047: Enterocolitis due to Clostridium difficile is coded based on the positive C. difficile DNA amplification assay and the clinical presentation of diarrhea, high WBC count, and treatment with vancomycin.
N179: Acute kidney failure, unspecified, is coded based on the initial lab values showing elevated creatinine and BUN, and the subsequent improvement in these values by discharge.
S3730XA: Unspecified injury of urethra, initial encounter, is coded due to the mention of traumatic hematuria, likely related to Foley catheter use and systemic anticoagulation.
I2510: Atherosclerotic heart disease of native coronary artery without angina pectoris is coded based on the documented coronary artery disease and the placement of a stent in the LAD.
E118: Type 2 diabetes mellitus with unspecified complications is coded based on the patient's history of DMII and the presence of complications like hyperglycemia and weight loss.
X58XXXA: Exposure to other specified factors, initial encounter, is coded to indicate the exposure to hospital-related factors contributing to the patient’s condition.
Y92239: Unspecified place in hospital as the place of occurrence of the external cause is coded to specify the hospital setting where the events occurred.
I10: Essential (primary) hypertension is coded based on the patient's known medical history.
E785: Hyperlipidemia, unspecified, is coded based on the patient's history of hyperlipidemia and the adjustment of lipid-lowering therapy during the hospital stay.
T45515A: Adverse effect of anticoagulants, initial encounter, is coded based on the mention of hematuria in the setting of systemic anticoagulation.
Z86718: Personal history of other venous thrombosis and embolism is coded based on the initiation of warfarin therapy, indicating a history of venous thromboembolic events.
Z7901: Long term (current) use of anticoagulants is coded due to the initiation of warfarin for atrial fibrillation and hypokinetic LV.
R310: Gross hematuria is coded based on the documentation of hematuria and the need for urology follow-up.
Z7902: Long term (current) use of antithrombotics/antiplatelets is coded due to the initiation of clopidogrel following stent placement.
I480: Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation is coded based on the patient’s history and the finding of atrial fibrillation during the hospital stay.
Z23: Encounter for immunization is not applicable to the provided medical record and should be excluded.
K2960: Other gastritis without bleeding is coded based on the diagnosis of H. Pylori and the treatment with antibiotics and a PPI.
B9681: Helicobacter pylori [H. pylori] as the cause of diseases classified elsewhere is coded based on the positive endoscopy result and the ongoing treatment for H. Pylori.
Z87891: Personal history of nicotine dependence is not mentioned in the medical record and should be excluded.
I252: Old myocardial infarction is coded based on the patient’s history of prior MI.

Dear Ms. ___,

It was a pleasure taking care of you at ___ 
___.

You were in the hospital because of headache, lethargy, and 
weakness after an iron infusion.

You had a number of tests performed in the hospital, all of 
which were reassuring. An MRI of your brain showed no evidence 
of stroke or inflammation. An EEG to monitor your brain waves 
showed no evidence of seizure. Your weakness gradually improved 
over the course of your hospitalization and will continue to 
improve after you leave the hospital. 

After leaving the hospital, you should continue to work on 
improving your strength. It will improve as long as you work 
hard!

We wish you the best,
Your ___ Care Team
 
Followup Instructions:

Here is the coding results:F4489:Other dissociative and conversion disorders
R29818:Other symptoms and signs involving the nervous system
I7300:Raynaud's syndrome without gangrene
I951:Orthostatic hypotension
R000:Tachycardia, unspecified
F410:Panic disorder [episodic paroxysmal anxiety]
E869:Volume depletion, unspecified
K219:Gastro-esophageal reflux disease without esophagitis
D509:Iron deficiency anemia, unspecified
D519:Vitamin B12 deficiency anemia, unspecified
F329:Major depressive disorder, single episode, unspecified

Please output the coding reason:<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
","F4489: Other dissociative and conversion disorders - The patient exhibits significant neurological symptoms such as lethargy, weakness, and difficulty moving limbs, which do not align with typical organic neurological disorders. The diagnosis of functional neurological syndrome suggests a psychological origin for these symptoms, fitting the criteria for a dissociative or conversion disorder.

R29818: Other symptoms and signs involving the nervous system - The patient presented with lethargy, headache, and photophobia, which are neurological symptoms that were investigated and found to be unexplained by organic causes.

I7300: Raynaud's syndrome without gangrene - The patient experienced mottling and discoloration of the feet during the iron infusion, which can be indicative of Raynaud's phenomenon, a condition characterized by vasospasm of the small arteries leading to reduced blood flow to the extremities.

I951: Orthostatic hypotension - The patient's examination noted sinus bradycardia, which, along with the context of lethargy and weakness, suggests possible autonomic dysfunction, including orthostatic hypotension.

R000: Tachycardia, unspecified - The patient had a reported heart rate of 58 BPM initially, but the history mentions episodes of tachycardia during the infusion reaction, which can be coded as tachycardia.

F410: Panic disorder [episodic paroxysmal anxiety] - The patient's symptoms, including nausea, heart racing, and shivering, could be consistent with a panic attack, especially in the context of the infusion reaction.

E869: Volume depletion, unspecified - The patient's history of anemia and recent infusion suggests potential volume depletion, which can contribute to symptoms like lethargy and weakness.

K219: Gastro-esophageal reflux disease without esophagitis - The patient has a history of chronic abdominal pain, which could be related to gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD).

D509: Iron deficiency anemia, unspecified - The patient has a history of anemia and received iron sucrose infusion, indicating iron deficiency anemia.

D519: Vitamin B12 deficiency anemia, unspecified - The lab results show a low vitamin B12 level (227), suggesting possible vitamin B12 deficiency anemia.

F329: Major depressive disorder, single episode, unspecified - The patient's lethargy, difficulty providing history, and tearfulness suggest possible underlying depression, which could contribute to the overall presentation."

Brief Hospital Course:
___ y/o ___ homeless F with PMHx of TBI, HIV+, HCV, 
polysubstance abuse (alcohol, crack cocaine, and heroin), 
unspecified mood disorder (MDD with psychotic features vs. 
substance-induced mood disorder), and chronic AH who presented 
from ___ station via EMS with complaint of multiple head strikes 
found to have EtOH intoxication and SI admitted to MICU for EtOH 
withdrawal and CIWA monitoring, now stabilized and transferred 
to the floor, now medically stable for discharge to psychiatric 
facility

ACTIVE ISSUES:
========================
# EtOH intoxication/withdrawal: on phenobarbital withdrawal 
protocol.  Last drink ___.  Patient was loaded with 
phenobarbital, which may continue if the accepting psychiatric 
facility is okay with administering, however there is no 
contraindication to discontinuing.
-Phenobarb protocol while inpatient, stopped at discharge
-Continued MVI, thiamine, folate
-Hydroxyzine PRN for additional agitation
-seen by psychiatry and social work - appreciated.

# Suicidal ideation: patient repeatedly stating ""I have suicidal 
thoughts"" and ""I'm depressed,"" though is unable to fully 
elaborate. Psychiatry saw the patient and had the following 
recommendations: -Patient meets ___ criteria for 
involuntary admission, may not leave AMA, should continue 1:1 
observation.
-Would hold on any psychiatric medications given acute alcohol 
withdrawal.
-If chemical restraint necessary, please call psychiatry for 
specific recs. Please be aware that patient has cited ""jaw 
locking"" with Haldol administration in the past, thus would 
consider alternative antipsychotic.
- seen by psychiatry - recommended inpatient psychiatric 
placement, and transferred to deac 4.

# FEVER: Patient febrile to 101 in the ED. No localizing signs 
of symptoms of infection. Suspect that this was likely related 
to acute ingestion, however given her murmur which has not been 
documented previously,  obtained TTE which showed no evidence of 
vegetation or endocarditis.

# Psychosis: suspect this is part of underlying psych disorder 
and not necessarily alcoholic hallucinosis.  Will defer to 
psychiatry.
-Appreciate Psychiatry recs

CHRONIC STABLE ISSUES:
========================
# HIV: not on HAART, started Bactrim for PCP prophylaxis given 
last CD4 count was <200, will send repeat CD4 count on ___ if 
still inpatient.  Patient was previously not taking her HAART 
medications, will defer to outpatient.

# HCV: not on active treatment
- Monitor LFTs, as above

Transitioanl issues:
Should see PCP re HIV and HCV once psychiatrically stabilized.

Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted for your mitral valve clip procedure. By 
repairing the valve your heart can pump blood more easily and 
your shortness of breath should improve.  
It is very important to take all of your heart healthy 
medications. In particular, you are now taking Aspirin and 
Clopidogrel (Plavix). These medications help to prevent blood 
clots from forming in/around the heart valve. If you stop these 
medications or miss ___ dose, you risk causing a blood clot 
forming on your heart valve. This could cause it to malfunction 
and it may be life threatening. Please do not stop taking 
Aspirin or Plavix without taking to your heart doctor, even if 
another doctor tells you to stop the medications. 
 
You will need prophylactic antibiotics prior to any dental 
procedure. Please obtain a prescription for a one-time dose of 
antibiotics prior to procedures, and inform your dentist about 
your recent cardiac procedure. 
 
Please weigh yourself every day in the morning after you go to 
the bathroom and before you get dressed. If your weight goes up 
by more than 3 lbs in 1 day or more than 5 lbs in 3 days, please 
call your heart doctor or your primary care doctor and alert 
them to this change. Your weight at discharge is 154 pounds. 
 
We have made changes to your medication list, so please make 
sure to take your medications as directed. You will also need to 
have close follow up with your heart doctor and your primary 
care doctor.  

If you were given any prescriptions on discharge, any future 
refills will need to be authorized by your outpatient providers, 
primary care or cardiologist.
 
If you have any urgent questions that are related to your 
recovery from your procedure or are experiencing any symptoms 
that are concerning to you and you think you may need to return 
to the hospital, please call the ___ Heart Line at

Brief Hospital Course:
SUMMARY:
=============
Ms. ___ is a ___ woman with stage IIIA squamous cell 
carcinoma of lung undergoing chemoradiation completed on 
___, history of multiple strokes and prior colon cancer s/p 
hemicolectomy who presents with odynophagia x several weeks, 
attributed to radiation esophagitis. 

ACUTE ISSUES:
====================
# Odynophagia/Dysphagia 
#Radiation Esophagitis
Managed with oral liquid lidocaine formulation, which improved 
patient's ability to tolerate PO. Speech and language pathology 
consutled, recommended soft ground diet and thin liquids, which 
was advanced to regular solids. Nutrition consulted as well. If 
symptoms fail to improve with liquid lidocaine and with a time 
course consistent with radiation esophagitis, will need further 
workup as outpatient, such as barium swallow or EGD. Patient was 
started on lansoprazole for any contribution of GERD, should 
continue to assess need for PPI as an outpatient.

# Hypernatremia
Patient with rising Na this admission, up to 149. Likely poor 
oral intake iso radiation esophagitis. Patient received 1L D5W 
with improvement of Na to 141 on day of discharge. She was 
encouraged to maintain liquids throughout the day.

# Severe Malnutrition
Patient with poor PO intake and weight loss. Nutrition was 
consulted, and per their recommendations she received Carnation 
supplements with soy milk with meals, as well as Ensure Clear 
with meals and multivitamins. PO intake was encouraged. SW was 
consulted due to concern about her having adequate resources at 
home (but she denies having issues with resources). ___ assessed 
her and recommended home, where she already has a walker. OOB 
with assistance was encouraged during the admission.

# Vitamin B12 deficiency
B12 was noted to be low this admission, so the patient received 
cyanocobalamin 1000 mcg IM on ___ and was started on PO 
cyanocobalamin daily. MMA was obtained, which was pending at 
time of discharge. CBC was obtained daily.

# Stage IIIA Squamous Cell Lung Carcinoma
Undergoing concurrent chemoradiation. Will follow up with Dr. 
___ as outpatient.

CHRONIC ISSUES:
=================
# Hypokalemia, chronic
Hypokalemia has been chronic. Etiology unclear as patient is not 
on diuretics. Other etiologies include kidney dysfunction such 
as rental tubular acidosis. Reportedly does not take potassium 
as often as necessary at home d/t difficulty swallowing pill. 
Urine
electrolytes notable for >20 K which seems inappropriate in 
setting of hypokalemia. Potassium powder was trialed during the 
admission.

# Diarrhea, stable
Patient reports loose stool since radiation. On admission did 
report blood in stool that is streaky and superficial; patient 
denied tarry stools or frank blood. The most concerning etiology 
would be recurrence of colorectal carcinoma (s/p hemicolectomy),
although more likely causes include diverticulosis flare or 
hemorrhoidal bleeding. Cdiff negative. Hb stable throughout this 
admission.

# Tobacco Abuse: Managed inpatient with nicotine patch. 

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
===========================
[] Ensure that patient is eating and drinking without difficulty
[] Continue to assess for presence of blood in stools
[] Should repeat CBC and BMP at next PCP visit to ensure stable 
Hb and Na/K
[] Previously on potassium tablets, but discharged on potassium 
powder given odynophagia, will need to follow up with ability to 
tolerate this.
[] Patient was started on lansoprazole for any contribution of 
GERD, should continue to assess need for PPI as an outpatient.
[] Found to have B12 deficiency anemia during this admission, 
received cyanocobalamin 1000 mcg IM on ___ and was started on 
PO cyanocobalamin daily, which she should continue.
[] Follow up on lab tests that were pending at time of 
discharge: campylobacter stool culture, stool ova + parasites, 
fecal culture r/o Yersinia, methylmalonic acid.
[] Patient was scheduled for outpatient CT chest ___, unable to 
complete as an inpatient, will need to be rescheduled by her 
oncology team

Brief Hospital Course:
Mrs. ___ is a ___ female with a medical history notable for 
DM2,
HTN, HLD, multiple strokes, inferior MI, tobacco use, and colon 
cancer, who presented with 3 weeks of increasing hemoptysis 
i/s/o a R hilar lung mass found on CT.

#Hemoptysis, R hilar mass
Her hemoptysis and R hilar mass is concerning for bronchogenic 
carcinoma given her history of smoking, colon cancer, and weight 
loss. She was stable without hypoxia or respiratory distress. 
Her home Plavix and aspirin were held, and her hemoptysis 
improved. IP consulted and planned for biopsy 
electrocautery/cryo +/- stent placement on ___, ___. She 
had a brain MRI on the evening of discharge that showed nothing 
acute, though follow-up on final read will be needed. She will 
also need a PET-CT for complete staging. She has been told to 
hold home Plavix until further notice (last dose ___ but 
continue her home aspirin. 

#Hypercalcemia
She has a history of primary hyperparathyroidism, but an 
elevated calcium level can also be seen as paraneoplastic 
syndrome. Her Ca was 10.5 on admission, in the same range as has 
been historically. She received her home Vitamin D, but no 
specific treatment was started.

# CVA
We held her home Plavix and aspirin per above.

multiple strokes w/ residual left hemiparesis, HTN, DL, and 
prior colon cancer s/p hemicolectomy who is transferred from 
___ for continuity of care after presenting 
there w/ confusion and worsening LUE weakness. 

ACTIVE ISSUES:
============
#Odynophagia/Dysphagia: Most likely radiation esophagitis, 
reflux esophagitis. ___ EGD with esophagitis, gastritis, 
duodenitis. Gastric biopsy showed H. pylori. She was given 
viscous lidocaine with meals, BID PPI, fluids as needed, and a 
regular diet. We had long discussions about her goals of care 
with both her outpatient oncology team as well as her palliative 
care team (detailed below) and it was ultimately decided to not 
pursue full antibiotic therapy for H. pylori as her primary 
symptom of odynophagia is most likely primarily related to 
strictures and radiation esophagitis. 

#Failure to thrive
Seems like most likely etiology is poor po intake. Felt to be 
due to progressive esophagitis (presumably radiation induced). 
She has odynophagia. TSH wnl. No e/o pulmonary infection. UA neg 
at OSH. C diff negative this admission. Geriatrics was involved 
in the patient's care during this admission. Her throat and body 
pain was controlled with IV morphine, and she received viscous 
lidocaine to help her eat/drink more comfortably. She was 
supported with IVF as needed. ___ and OT evaluated her and 
recommended rehab placement however after long discussions of 
her GOC and it was decided that she would not want tube feeding 
and would like to go home on hospice. 

#Nonocclusive thrombus in right IJ
In the setting of being hypercoagulable from malignancy. 
HAS-BLED score is 3 (HTN, stroke Hx, age she is at high risk for 
major bleeding, but is hypercogulable iso malignancy. The 
definitive treatment for her hypercoagulable state is treatment 
of her malignancy, if within GOC. Her home ASA/Plavix were 
continued, and she was started on enoxaparin 80 mg SC daily, 
with the plan to treat for 1 month.

#Stage IIIA Squamous Cell Lung Carcinoma
#Bilateral lytic scapular lesions
Most recent imaging, CT chest on ___, revealed substantial 
decrease in size of the pre-existing right hilar mass, which now 
measures 20 x 20 mm in diameter. However CT abd revealed ""new 
1.3 cm hepatic segment VII lesion ... suspicious for 
metastasis."" ___ elevated this admission, consistent with liver 
involvement. Now CT from ___ revealed new bilateral lytic 
scapular lesions.
Outpatient team arranging PET scan in ___, with future 
cancer treatment directed therapies to be determined. Her 
outpatient oncology team (Drs ___ was contacted 
with updates. Hip/femur x-rays were obtained to eval for 
osseous/lytic lesions (because of delays with scheduling a bone 
scan).

#Encephalopathy 
She's been having episodes of confusion for some time now per 
daughter. She locked herself in the bathroom last week. 
""Thetiles have me locked in the bathroom and I can't get out."" 
But the bathroom was not locked. A few weeks ago, she had left 
the stove on during a hot day, and she stated she was heating 
food for her son (who was murdered ___. Daughter is 
concerned
about dementia. MRI brain did not reveal mets or new stroke. 
although pt is oriented x 3, she seems to have poor insight into 
reason for admission and her hospitalization. Confusion possibly 
also due to impaired sleep (sleeps during day, as lives with her 
son who works nights), dehydration, pain from malignancy. 
Geriatrics was consulted and assisted with her care. Her 
nutrition and hydration status were optimized and her pain was 
controlled with IV morphine. She received high dose thiamine for 
possible Wernicke's encephalopathy. She received folic acid 
repletion for severe protein calorie malnutrition.

CHRONIC/RESOLVED ISSUES:
========================
#Worsening LUE and LLE weakness - stable
#History of CVA w/ residual hemiparesis
Likely recrudescence from prior CVA and improved w/ hydration 
and nutrition. Her home aspirin, Plavix, and atorvastatin were 
continued. Her neurologic status was checked daily. She was 
started on Lovenox ___aily.

#Severe protein calorie malnutrition: 
- Nutrition was consulted. She received a regular diet, high 
dose thiamine, folic acid and MVI. Her electrolytes were 
monitored daily and repleted as needed.

#Tobacco Abuse: Continued nicotine patch.

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
====================
[] Due to esophageal spasms seen during EGD, outpatient 
esophageal mannometry should be considered to further work up 
her dysphagia/odynophagia.
[] Consider starting a bisphosphonate, if osseous metastases are 
confirmed through bone scan/bone biopsy.

Code status: DNR/DNI

IMPRESSION: 
1. Small right caudate hypodensity/lacunar infarct is new from 
___, but 
otherwise appears chronic to possibly subacute, lacunar infarct. 
  Correlate 
with clinical symptoms.  MRI is more sensitive in detecting 
acute ischemia. 
2. Sequelae of prior right frontal lobe infarct and left pontine 
infarct. 
3. Nonspecific bilateral white matter changes are similar the 
prior exam and 
consistent with sequelae of chronic small vessel ischemic 
disease. 
4. No acute intracranial hemorrhage. 
5. Cortical atrophy. 

CXR 
IMPRESSION:  
No focal consolidation to suggest pneumonia.  Possible minimal 
pulmonary 
vascular congestion.  Stable mild cardiomegaly. 

MRI/MRA brain and neck
IMPRESSION: 
1. Substantially motion limited exam. 
2. Punctate, likely subacute infarcts of the right frontal 
periventricular 
white matter, posterior limb of the right internal capsule or 
right thalamus , 
and right periatrial white matter. 
3. Chronic right frontal cortical infarct is again seen.  
Extensive 
supratentorial white matter signal abnormalities, similar to 
prior, 
nonspecific but likely sequela of chronic small vessel ischemic 
disease in 
this age group. 
4. Nondominant left vertebral artery is diminutive and not 
adequately assessed 
on this motion limited exam.  0 
5. Atherosclerosis of the proximal right internal carotid artery 
is again seen 
but could be exaggerated by artifact.  Apparent irregularity of 
the left 
proximal internal carotid artery, of the V2 and V3 segments of 
the right 
vertebral artery, of the left greater than right carotid 
siphons, and of the 
distal M1 and M2 segments of the left middle cerebral artery 
probably 
represents a combination of atherosclerosis and artifacts. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ RH female with a PMHx of paramedian pontine infarct (___), 
right-sided lenticulostriate territory infarct (___), multiple 
strokes in the right posterior MCA/PCA watershed region (thought 
to be cardioembolic but no source identified, ___ 
Plavix and ASA, HTN, HLD, prior MI, colon cancer s/p resection 
and chemotherapy in ___, extensive tobacco use, recent DM 
diagnosis, and recent diagnosis of B12 deficiency presents with 
4 week hx of progressively worsening left leg weakness and 
falls. On exam she had no signs of neuropathy, intact sensation 
to light touch, temperature and Pin Prick as well as intact 
proprioception. CT Head with right caudate hypodensity of 
indeterminate age, but appears subacute/chronic. MRI/MRA brain 
and neck with punctate, likely subacute infarcts of the right 
frontal periventricular white matter, posterior limb of the 
right internal capsule or right thalamus and right periatrial 
white matter. 
Etiology most likely secondary to known intracranial athero seen 
on imaging vs. small vessel disease. Patient already on 
appropriate secondary stroke prophylaxis and thus no changes to 
her medications were made. She was evaluated by physical therapy 
who recommended home ___.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear ___ were hospitalized due to symptoms of left leg weakness and 
falls resulting from an ACUTE ISCHEMIC STROKE, a condition where 
a blood vessel providing oxygen and nutrients to the brain is 
blocked by a clot. The brain is the part of your body that 
controls and directs all the other parts of your body, so damage 
to the brain from being deprived of its blood supply can result 
in a variety of symptoms.
Stroke can have many different causes, so we assessed ___ for 
medical conditions that might raise your risk of having stroke. 
In order to prevent future strokes, we plan to modify those risk 
factors. Your risk factors are:
HTN
atherosclerotic disease

No changes to your medications were made since ___ are already 
on the appropriate secondary stroke prevention.

Please take your other medications as prescribed.

Please follow up with Neurology and your primary care physician 
as listed below.

If ___ experience any of the symptoms below, please seek 
emergency medical attention by calling Emergency Medical 
Services (dialing 911). In particular, since stroke can recur, 
please pay attention to the sudden onset and persistence of 
these symptoms:
- Sudden partial or complete loss of vision
- Sudden loss of the ability to speak words from your mouth
- Sudden loss of the ability to understand others speaking to 
___
- Sudden weakness of one side of the body

Discharge Instructions:
-Please also refer to the provided handout that details 
instructions and expectations for your post-operative phase as 
made available by your urologist. 

-Resume your pre-admission/home medications except as noted. 
ALWAYS call to inform, review and discuss any medication changes 
and your post-operative course with your primary care doctor.

-___ reduce the strain/pressure on your abdomen and incision 
sites; remember to log roll onto your side and then use your 
hands to push yourself upright while taking advantage of the 
momentum of putting your legs/feet to the ground.

--There may be bandage strips called steristrips which have 
been applied to reinforce wound closure.  Allow these bandage 
strips to fall off on their own over time but PLEASE REMOVE ANY 
REMAINING GAUZE DRESSINGS WITHIN 2 DAYS OF DISCHARGE. You may 
get the steristrips wet.

-UNLESS OTHERWISE NOTED; AVOID aspirin or aspirin containing 
products and supplements that may have blood-thinning effects 
(like Fish Oil, Vitamin E, etc.).  This will be noted in your 
medication reconciliation. 

IF PRESCRIBED (see the MEDICATION RECONCILIATION):
-IBUPROFEN (the ingredient of Advil, Motrin, etc.) may be taken 
even though you may also be taking Tylenol/Acetaminophen. You 
may alternate these medications for pain control.  

For pain control, try TYLENOL (acetaminophen) FIRST, then 
ibuprofen, and then take the narcotic pain medication as 
prescribed if additional pain relief is needed.

-Ibuprofen should always be taken with food. Please discontinue 
taking and notify your doctor should you develop blood in your 
stool (dark, tarry stools)

-Call your Urologist's office to schedule/confirm your follow-up 
appointment in 4 weeks AND if you have any questions.

couch potato

-Tylenol should be your first-line pain medication. A narcotic 
pain medication has been prescribed for breakthrough pain ___.

-Max daily Tylenol (acetaminophen) dose is THREE to FOUR grams 
from ALL sources

AVOID lifting/pushing/pulling items heavier than 10 pounds (or 
3 kilos; about a gallon of milk) or participate in high 
intensity physical activity (which includes intercourse) until 
you are cleared by your Urologist in follow-up.

-No DRIVING for THREE WEEKS or until you are cleared by your 
Urologist

-You may shower normally but do NOT immerse your incisions or 
bathe

-Do not drive or drink alcohol while taking narcotics and do not 
operate dangerous machinery

-You may be given prescriptions for a stool softener and/or a 
gentle laxative. These are  over-the-counter medications that 
may be health care spending account reimbursable. 

-Colace (docusate sodium) may have been prescribed to avoid 
post-surgical constipation or constipation related to use of 
narcotic pain medications. Discontinue if loose stool or 
diarrhea develops. Colace is a stool-softener, NOT a laxative.

-Senokot (or any gentle laxative) may have been prescribed to 
further minimize your risk of constipation. 

-If you have fevers > 101.5 F, vomiting, or increased redness, 
swelling, or discharge from your incision, call your doctor or 
go to the nearest emergency room.

Please output the coding reason:<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
","D497: The patient had a right adrenal mass, which is an endocrine gland. Since the pathology report is not mentioned and the nature of the mass is not specified, it is coded as a neoplasm of unspecified behavior of the endocrine glands.

K740: The postoperative diagnosis mentions ""possible liver fibrosis,"" indicating a condition where there is scarring of the liver tissue, which is coded as hepatic fibrosis.

I10: The past medical history notes that the patient has hypertension. Since there is no mention of secondary causes or complications, essential (primary) hypertension is coded.

K219: The patient is on omeprazole, which is commonly used to treat gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). There is no mention of esophagitis, so GERD without esophagitis is coded.

K660: While not explicitly mentioned in the narrative, the presence of peritoneal adhesions is inferred from the surgical procedure and the nature of the surgery (laparoscopic right adrenalectomy), which can lead to postprocedural adhesions.

Z87891: This code is not directly supported by the information in the medical record. There is no mention of nicotine dependence or smoking history. If this code was included, it might be based on additional information not present in the provided text. However, based on the given information, this code is not justified."

Port-A-Cath catheter tip is at the level of the right 
ventricular outflow tract.  The double tube has been removed.  
There is substantial distension of the stomach that might 
potentially benefit from the NG tube insertion.  What appears to 
be a E ureteral stent is partially imaged. Bilateral pleural 
effusions, right more than left are present. Vascular congestion 
is noted, borderline with mild interstitial pulmonary edema. 

___ KUB
1. A right double J stent projects over the expected location of 
the right renal pelvis and bladder.  The stent is unchanged in 
position since ___. 
2. The stomach is distended with air. 

___ TTE
The left atrium is moderately dilated. Left ventricular wall 
thicknesses and cavity size are normal. Regional left 
ventricular wall motion is normal. Overall left ventricular 
systolic function is low normal (LVEF 50-55%). The estimated 
cardiac index is normal (>=2.5L/min/m2). Tissue Doppler imaging 
suggests a normal left ventricular filling pressure 
(PCWP<12mmHg). The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated 
with normal free wall contractility. The aortic valve leaflets 
(3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. 
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets 
are structurally normal. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild 
to moderate (___) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is mild 
to moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no 
pericardial effusion. 

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of ___, the 
findings are similar.

to the MICU ___. 
  She peacefully passed away with her family and family pastor 
present in the room at ___ on ___. 
 
#Hypercarbic respiratory failure: The pt consistently required 
nasal cannula up to 6 L while on the floor. This was thought to 
be due to volume overload and increased work of breathing. While 
in the CCU pt became more lethargic and an ABG showed 
hypercarbic respiratory failure.  She was intubated by 
anesthesia.  CXR showed large bilateral pleural effusions and 
she was grossly anasarcic.  IP placed a right chest tube to 
drain the effusion which showed that it was malignant with 
cytology showing adenocarcinoma.  She was extubated successfully 
on ___ and was weaned down to room air thereafter.  She was 
able to be comfortable on room air for the rest of her 
admission.

# Encephalopathy: although the pt's mental status had noticed to 
be declining on the floor, she was still able to answer 
appropriately. After extubation, the pt was noted to be very 
lethargic and minimally responsive. EEG was done which showed 
triphasic waves consistent with an encephalopathy. The pt was 
trialed on Ativan and Keppra. Her mental status remained very 
poor in spite of continued Keppra.  Neuro signed off after head 
imaging was unrevealing.  Mental status continued to wax and 
wane through the rest of her time. 

# Stage IV surgical dehiscence: Patient had correction of 
abdominoperineal resection defect with a right vertical rectus 
abdominis muscular cutaneous flap in ___ following 
resection of anal cancer. She presented to the hospital with 
stage IV, MRSA + sacral ulcer with concern for osteomyelitis, as 
wound probes to bone. CT scan with no mention of sacral 
osteomyelitis. GI deferred to plastics as they did flap surgery. 
Plastics does not recommend surgical intervention at this time. 
MRI shows no signs of osteomyelitis. This wound remained stable 
during her hospital course. 

# ___: Baseline Creatinine 0.8. Creatinine on admission was 2.1 
in setting of diuresis but also possible hypotension from afib 
with RVR. Pt is grossly volume overloaded with hypoalbumenemia. 
Concern for prerenal vs. intrinsic with possible multiple 
myeloma involvement vs obstructive. Creatinine remains above 2.0 
today. Renal consulted and believed that her ___ was 
predominantly secondary to obstruction. After stent exchange by 
urology ___, renal function improved with a Cr to 1.5 with IV 
fluids and remained stable. 
 
# Gastric Distension: Patient developed nausea and 1 episode of 
vomiting ___ with increasing distention. And xray ___ 
showed significant gastric distension. NG tube was placed and 
>1L was drawn off. Patient's reported symptomatic improvement. 
Patient continued to have ostomy output throughout episode. No 
mass appreciated on exam though obese abdomen. Patient not on 
narcotic medication. On ___, NG tube was clamped without 
recurrence of distention, patient denies nausea or distension. 
Unable to get CT abd due to poor kidney function, but got OSH CT 
read by our radiologists. It was notable for new retroperitoneal 
mass encasing aorta throughout abdomen. It is touching and 
possibly invading ___ and ___ portion of duodenum, potentially 
explaining gastric obstruction symptoms. Invades pancreatic 
head, explaining ductal dilatation. Also surrounding common 
iliac vessels, and both ureters (hydronephrosis worse since 
___. Speech and swallow was consulted who said the pt 
should be strict NPO. Tube feeds were started.  

# Tube feeds: On ___ Ms. ___ was no longer tolerating 
her tube feeds due to very high residuals.  Tube feeds were 
stopped and she was given nutrition with D5NS at 75/hr.  ___ 
attempted to place the Dobhoff tube post-pyloric but they were 
unable to pass the tube through the pylorus and noted contrast 
barely trickles through ___ obstruction. In family meetings the 
family was informed that the feeding tube could not be advanced, 
and that other options such as TPN would likely harm the pt more 
than help her because of her risk for bloodstream infection and 
metabolic derangements.  

# Metastatic anal adenocarcinoma: large retroperitoneal mass 
compressing the abdomen and constricting the aorta at the level 
of the iliacs noted on CT from OSH, thought to be metastasis 
from her known anal adenocarcinoma. Per onc, not a candidate for 
chemotherapy, so likely not worth biopsying even though 
definitive diagnosis would not otherwise be reached. Recommend 
getting palliative care involved and having goals of care 
discussion with family.  First family meeting was ___ and 
son, ___, wanted us to do everything we could to help Ms. 
___. This continued to be a theme during her hospital stay, 
and several meetings were held with the family to discuss goals 
of care.  On ___ it was decided to switch to focusing on her 
comfort only.

# Volume overload: Likely from diastolic heart failure but will 
need to rule out hypoalbuminemic state, and cirrhosis. Patient 
with gross volume overload with 2+ ___ edema, bilateral effusions 
and CT with anasarca on abdominal imaging.  TTE unchanged from 
previous with EF 55% and no gross valvular dysfunction. TSH 
elevated, T4 WNLs. Patient given albumin ___ with good 
response.  However, patient still significantly overloaded.  On 
___ she was anuric and hypotensive despite having 
significant lower extremity and abdominal edema.  She was 
transferred to the MICU on this day.  While in the MICU she was 
stabilized and pressors were downtitrated.  Poor response to 
Lasix alone but given Lasix and Chlorothiazide with good UOP.  
 
# Hematuria: Unclear cause but patient was on anticoagulation. 
Concern would be primarily for tumor infiltration. Hematuria 
intermittent, but seems to recur during transport. Potential 
mechanical irritation. Patient continues to pass dime sized 
clots. Stent exchange done ___ by urology, with improvement in 
her hematuria.  Hematuria with clots returned on ___.  
Urology recommended CBI which was started ___.  She had 
CBI intermittently throughout her stay to relieve foley 
obstructions. 
 
# Normocytic Anemia: Hgb at ___ 8.6. No evidence of 
bleeding. She does have stage III CKD. MCV within normal range 
and iron studies not particularly suggestive of iron deficiency 
anemia with ferritin of 781. Folate level of 7.4 and B12 of 411. 
Concern could possibly be for chronic low grade bleed from gut 
or hematuria. (transfused evening of ___.  Hgb remained 
stable in the 7's until ___ when H/H dropped to ___.  
This same day she triggered for hypotension of 86/Doppler.  As 
she was anuric at this  time there was concern of intraabdominal 
bleeding and was one of the indications for MICU transfer.  Pt 
had episode of gross hematuria requiring CBI and pRBC 
transfusion for BP control.  Pt required Vasopressin and 
Phenylephrine while in the MICU but was able to be weaned off.  
She required intermittent pRBC transfusions during her time in 
the MICU.
 
# AFib on coumadin: CHADS 2 of 3. Hemodynamically unstable with 
RVR upon arrival, but controlled with diltiazem and metoprolol.  
She remained in AFib during her hospital stay.  Due to her 
hematuria and dropping H/H, blood pressure medications and 
ultimately SQH were discontinued on ___.   Pt put on an 
esmolol gtt as she had afib with RVR into the 130s on her first 
day in the ICU. She was taken off the esmolol drip and 
thereafter controlled with IV metoprolol and achieved good 
control on PO metoprolol with heart rates in the ___. 

# Hypertension: Currently normotensive.  See above for issues 
with hypotension and reason for MICU transfer ___. 
 
# IgG Myeloma: Patient with longstanding IgG MM, followed by 
___ Oncology. Currently not on revlimid or dexamethasone. 
Kappa:lamba increase, but can be seen in kidney disease.  Atrius 
oncology followed patient throughout hospital stay.

dabigatran, HFpEF, HTN, HLD, chronic hyponatremia, who presents 
after a fall at her nursing home.  

Pt unable to provide history, but per nursing home and OSH 
notes, in early AM on ___, pt fell and was discovered by nursing 
home RN. RN at that time noted that pt was confused and 
lethargic. HR at that time per report was in the ___. EMS was 
activated and pt brought to OSH ER. En route, EMS report 
indicates that heart rates were labile, but there are no EKG 
strips and unclear if pt received any cardiac medications. At 
OSH ER, pt's EKG revealed bradycardia to 20 with ventricular 
escape and no signs of atrial activity. The pt was then given 1 
mg of atropine with no effect and then transcutaneously paced 
for 1 hour. She was then noted to have HRs in the ___ and atrial 
activity. She was then transferred to ___ for possible PPM. 

Here at ___, noted to be intermittently lethargic and poorly 
responsive. CT head and neck negative. EP was consulted for 
possible PPM and initially recommended admission to ___, 
deferred PPM for the time being. She continued to be 
intermittently bradycardic to the ___ in the ED, but given that 
she has a history of previous bradycardia and has been 
asymptomatic with her episodes, she was felt to be stable for 
the floor. However, after this she had increasing respiratory 
distress requiring a NRB. Due to this she was admitted to the 
CCU. Received Lasix 60mg IV x1.
 
 Of note, pt's HCP reports that she had been more altered over 
the last week in the setting of higher doses of seroquel that 
the nursing home had started for increased agitation.

I5033: Acute on chronic diastolic (congestive) heart failure - The patient has a history of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF), which is a form of diastolic heart failure. The labs and imaging suggest ongoing heart failure, and the patient required treatment with Lasix, indicating an acute exacerbation of her chronic condition.

F0391: Unspecified dementia, unspecified severity, with behavioral disturbance - The patient has a documented history of dementia, and her recent increase in confusion and altered mental status could be attributed to this condition, especially in the context of increased agitation and higher doses of Seroquel.

I2582: Chronic total occlusion of coronary artery - The patient has a documented history of CAD with a 100% LAD occlusion, which is consistent with a chronic total occlusion of a coronary artery.

E871: Hypo-osmolality and hyponatremia - The patient has a history of chronic hyponatremia, which is confirmed by lab results (Na 140 and 141).

Z9181: History of falling - The patient presented to the hospital after a fall at her nursing home, and this is a relevant history to include.

I2510: Atherosclerotic heart disease of native coronary artery without angina pectoris - The patient has a documented history of CAD, which is a form of atherosclerotic heart disease.

I252: Old myocardial infarction - The patient has a history of an MI, likely related to her CAD.

I10: Essential (primary) hypertension - The patient has a documented history of hypertension, which is managed with multiple antihypertensive medications.

I350: Nonrheumatic aortic (valve) stenosis - The patient has a documented history of mild aortic stenosis.

I4891: Unspecified atrial fibrillation - The patient has a documented history of atrial fibrillation/flutter, for which she is on dabigatran.

Z7902: Long term (current) use of antithrombotics/antiplatelets - The patient is on dabigatran, which is an anticoagulant, for her atrial fibrillation.

E785: Hyperlipidemia, unspecified - The patient has a documented history of dyslipidemia, which is a risk factor for her CAD.

Z66: Do not resuscitate - The patient was made DNR/DNI/DNH during her hospital stay, indicating her end-of-life care preferences."

CXR ___
FINDINGS:  
Patient is status post median sternotomy and CABG. Left-sided 
AICD is noted with single lead terminating in the right 
ventricle.  Heart size is normal. Mediastinal and hilar contours 
are normal. Lungs are clear. No pleural effusion or 
pneumothorax. No acute osseous abnormalities are detected. 
IMPRESSION: No acute cardiopulmonary abnormality. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ M with h/o ischemic cardiomyopathy (s/p PCI/stent, CABG, 
ICD pacemaker) c/b systolic CHF (LVEF 27%), L MCA stroke, and 
perirectal abscess who presents with hypotension and new ___ in 
the setting fluid restriction while taking multiple diuretics 
and anti-hypertensives. 

#Hypotension: Pt presented with a baseline SBP in ___ over past 
year, was fluid restricting given history of pulmonary edema, 
presented with SBP in 60-70s in ED. After 500cc fluid bolus, SBP 
returned to baseline and pt was asymptomatic. Patient was not 
orthostatic. Bolused additional 1L NS. Hypotension seemed likely 
attributable to self fluid restriction in the setting of 
multiple diuretic and anti-hypertensive medications. Losartan, 
Spironolactone, Carvedilol and Torsemide were held on discharge. 
Patient was instructed to schedule primary care to have 
follow-up of his laboratory values.

___: Rise in pt's Cr to 2.8 from baseline of 1.1 with 
associated BUN/Cr >20. UA was unremarkable. Pt was maintaining 
UOP, w/ no history to suggest post-renal obstruction. Elevated 
pro-BNP suggestive of ventricular overload c/w history of 
ischemic cardiomyopathy, possible cardiorenal contribution to 
___. Overall findings were pre-renal ___, likely ___ decreased 
effective circulating volume in the setting of hypotension and 
fluid restriction in pt with underlying ischemic cardiomyopathy. 
He responded well to 1.5L IVFs, with a creatinine of 1.8 at time 
of discharge. He was instructed to improve his PO intake to 1.5L 
per day (has hx of CHF exacerbations). Antihypertensives were 
held at time of discharge. 

#Hyperphosphatemia: Phos to 5.1 on ___. Likely ___ renal 
insufficiency. He was given a low phosphate diet for one day.

#Normocytic Anemia: H/H down to 11.3/33.8 on ___ AM. Had low 
suspicion for hemolysis or acute blood loss. Was thought to be 
likely dilutional after fluids and was consistent with pt's 
normal range.

RESOLVED ISSUES: 
#Leukocytosis: Patient presented with transient leukocytosis, 
which downtrended to wnl ___ AM, likely ___ acute stress 
reaction. CXR/UA was not concerning for infection. Further 
infectious workup was not pursued.

CHRONIC ISSUES: 
#Ischemic Cardiomyopathy: s/p L ICD placement. No evidence of 
volume overload on exam ___. Losartan, Spironolactone, 
Torsemide, Carvedilol in were held in the setting of hypotension 
and ___, and also held on discharge.
#Hypertension: Losartan, Spironolactone, Torsemide, Carvedilol 
were held as above. 
#Hyperlipidemia: atorvastatin was continued without issue.
#History of MCA stroke: continued home warfarin without issue.

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
-patient was instructed to drink 1.5 L of fluid per day
-patient's home antihypertensives were held at time of 
discharge.
-patient was instructed to follow-up with his PCP within one 
week
-patient may benefit from a repeat Na, K, Cl, bicarb, BUN, Cr at 
time of follow-up
-consideration of when to restart home antihypertensives can be 
considered at follow-up.

Please output the coding reason:<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
","N179: Acute kidney failure, unspecified - Reason: The patient had an acute rise in creatinine to 2.8 from a baseline of 1.1, along with an elevated BUN/Cr ratio, indicating acute kidney injury. The diagnosis was attributed to pre-renal causes, likely due to decreased effective circulating volume from hypotension and fluid restriction.

I5022: Chronic systolic (congestive) heart failure - Reason: The patient has a known history of ischemic cardiomyopathy with a reduced ejection fraction (LVEF 27%) and systolic heart failure. The patient was monitored for signs of volume overload during the hospital stay, but there was no evidence of active heart failure exacerbation.

I959: Hypotension, unspecified - Reason: The patient presented with hypotension (BP 79/42 in the ED) and a history of systolic blood pressure in the 60-70s. The hypotension was attributed to fluid restriction and the use of multiple diuretics and antihypertensive medications. The condition improved with IV fluids and the holding of certain medications.

E8339: Fall on stairs or ladders in water transport injuring unspecified person - Reason: This code appears to be incorrect based on the provided medical record. There is no mention of a fall or any injury related to stairs or ladders in water transport. This code should be removed.

I2510: Atherosclerotic heart disease of native coronary artery without angina pectoris - Reason: The patient has a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) with a myocardial infarction (MI) and subsequent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with stent placement. There is no mention of current angina pectoris.

Z951: Presence of aortocoronary bypass graft - Reason: The patient has a history of coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), which is documented in the medical record.

Z950: Presence of cardiac pacemaker - Reason: The patient has a single lead implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) pacemaker, which is noted in the physical exam and medical history.

Z8673: Personal history of transient ischemic attack (TIA), and cerebral infarction without residual deficits - Reason: The patient has a history of an ischemic stroke involving the left middle cerebral artery (MCA).

D649: Anemia, unspecified - Reason: The patient had a normocytic anemia with hemoglobin and hematocrit levels of 11.3 and 33.8, respectively. The anemia was thought to be dilutional after fluid administration and was consistent with the patient's normal range.

F17210: Nicotine dependence, cigarettes, uncomplicated - Reason: This code appears to be incorrect based on the provided medical record. There is no mention of nicotine dependence or smoking history. This code should be removed.

I10: Essential (primary) hypertension - Reason: The patient has a history of hypertension (HTN), which is managed with multiple antihypertensive medications. The hypertension is noted in the past medical history.

E785: Hyperlipidemia, unspecified - Reason: The patient has a history of hyperlipidemia (HLD), which is managed with atorvastatin. The condition is noted in the past medical history.

I255: Ischemic cardiomyopathy - Reason: The patient has a known history of ischemic cardiomyopathy, which is documented in the past medical history and is the underlying cause of the chronic systolic heart failure."

History of dilated ischemic cardiomyopathy, ___ Class II, EDW 
previously documented as 185-187lbs, but likely closer to 
190-195lbs given relatively dry RHC at this weight. On 
presentation he was well compensated. RHC was performed while 
inpatient which had largely normal pressures and it was 
discovered that his cardiomems was not calibrated correctly and 
still is reporting falsely elevated numbers. He had a few days 
off diuretics due to NPO status for procedures and mild 
hypotension, then restarted on his home dosing at discharge. He 
previously had a CPET that demonstrated poor function. This 
should be repeated now that he is optimized to reassess his need 
for LVAD/transplant.

as an outpatient with an outpatient dentist with no need to hold 
apixaban. If there are concerns from his primary dentist, he can 
be referred to our outpatient ___ clinic for extraction. 
- Underwent right heart catheterization on ___ which 
demonstrated only mildly elevated filling pressures including a 
mildly elevated PASP, which is significantly improved from 
prior. Vasodilator study was not performed given low pulmonary 
pressures.

pulmonary edema (R>L) and enlarged mediastinal/hilar lymph 
nodes. Given these findings, IP was consulted and he underwent 
bronchoscopy w/ EBUS and lymph node biopsies on ___. Per 
pulmonology, unclear etiology of the lymph nodes. Initially 
thought to be just pulmonary edema but RHC showed he was fairly 
euvolemic. Other possibilities include prior granulomatous 
disease or, less likely, lymphoma.

# Perianal fistula
Initially presented ___ s/p multiple exams under anesthesia, 
I&D, most recently ___ abscess was drained and malecot 
catheter placed. Evaluated by ___ ___ ___ clinic after 
referral from cardiology for pre-transplant evaluation. They 
noted no evidence of abscess but recommended exam under 
anesthesia with management of fistula ___ ano. He underwent anal

IMAGING
___ CT C/A/P:
1. Severe T12 compression fracture with slight retropulsion of 
the superior T2 endplate, indeterminate age. 
2. Multiple fractures of posterior and lateral ___ ribs, 
some of which demonstrate developing callus, suggesting subacute 
chronicity. 
3. Acute appearing right L1 transverse process fracture, and 
probable T10 and T11 spinous process fractures. 
4. Status post aortic bifemoral bypass with complete occlusion 
of right bypass graft. 
5. 3.5 cm fluid collection encasing the left bypass graft in the 
left lower quadrant, likely representing a seroma. 
6. Apparent filling defect in the left common femoral vein, 
likely mixing 
artifact.  However, ultrasound is recommended to evaluate for 
possible DVT. 
7. UIP pattern of pulmonary fibrosis in the bilateral lung 
bases. 
8. Diverticulosis without evidence of acute diverticulitis. 
9. 4.2 cm abdominal aortic aneurysm at the level of the aortic 
hiatus. 

___ L ___:
IMPRESSION:  
No evidence of deep venous thrombosis in the left lower 
extremity veins. 

___ CT head:
1. Mild left frontal subarachnoid hemorrhage. No prior studies 
available for comparison. 
2. Presumed arachnoid cyst in the left middle cranial fossa. 

___ TTE:
The left atrial volume index is normal. There is no evidence for 
an atrial septal defect by 2D/color Doppler.
The estimated right atrial pressure is ___ mmHg. There is mild 
(non-obstructive) hypertrophy of the basal
septum with a normal cavity size. There is normal regional left 
ventricular systolic function. Global left
ventricular systolic function is normal. The visually estimated 
left ventricular ejection fraction is 60%. Left
ventricular cardiac index is normal (>2.5L/min/m2) No 
ventricular septal defect is seen. There is no resting
left ventricular outflow tract gradient. Normal right 
ventricular cavity size with normal free wall motion. The
aortic sinus diameter is normal with normal ascending aorta 
diameter. The aortic arch diameter is normal.
There are simple atheroma in the abdominal aorta. The aortic 
valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. There is
moderate aortic valve stenosis (valve area 1.0-1.5 cm2). There 
is no aortic regurgitation. The mitral leaflets
are mildly thickened with no mitral valve prolapse. There is 
moderate mitral annular calcification. There is no
mitral valve stenosis. There is mild [1+] mitral regurgitation. 
Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity of mitral
regurgitation could be UNDERestimated. The tricuspid valve 
leaflets appear structurally normal. There is trivial
tricuspid regurgitation. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic 
pressure is normal. There is no pericardial
effusion.
IMPRESSION: Adequate image quality. Moderate low gradient aortic 
stenosis. Normal biventricular systolic
function.

___ XR shoulder/humerus:
1. No fracture or dislocation. 
2. Multiple focal lucencies in the left humeral shaft could 
reflect osteopenia but raise concern for multiple myeloma or 
diffuse metastatic disease, which could be further evaluated 
with MRI, SPEP, and UPEP. 
3. Moderate to severe degenerative changes of the 
acromioclavicular 
glenohumeral joints. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ is an ___ with history of dementia, PAD, HTN, 
CAD, COPD, prior pelvic fracture s/p hip replacement who 
presented to an OSH with an unwitnessed fall and was transferred 
to ___ due to CT head showing SAH. Transferred to the medicine 
service for encephalopathy. 

# Encephalopathy, toxic/metabolic: Patient was acutely altered 
on admission with waxing and waning mental status consistent 
with delirium on baseline of mild dementia. Found to have 
symptomatic UTI which was a like contributor as well as 
pain/trauma from her fall. She was started on antibiotics and 
improved back to baseline.

# Small left frontal traumatic SAH: Sustained in her fall. She 
had repeat head CT that showed stability. She was evaluated by 
neurosurgery who felt no surgical intervention was needed. Her 
home aspirin and prophylactic subcutaneous heparin were started 
on ___. Her goal blood pressure was under 160 and was maintained 
throughout her hospitalization. Per neurosurgery she did not 
need seizure prophylaxis and did not need neurosurgery follow up 
as an outpatient. Sutures were placed for her head laceration 
and can be removed on ___. 
 
# T12 compression fracture
# L1 transverse fracture: Per orthospine, likely chronic and 
unrelated to recent fall. She worked with ___ who recommended 
rehab. She is weight bearing as tolerated and ROM as tolerated. 
She should follow up with spine clinic 2 weeks after discharge. 
Pain control was with lidocaine patch and Tylenol. Her home 
tramadol was restarted on discharge at reduced dose.  

# Fall: She suffered an unwitnessed fall and had poor memory of 
the event. She is on a number of medications that could 
pre-dispose to falls including multiple antihypertensives (and 
had positive orthostatics in-house) and sedating/pain 
mediations. Symptomatic UTI likely contributer as well. A TTE 
revealed moderate AS. Telemetry revealed rare short runs of 
self-terminating SVT. Low suspicion overall for cardiac cause of 
her fall. Her antihypertensives were held with acceptable blood 
pressures throughout (SBPs < 160). Her tramadol and gabapentin 
(which had been newly started/uptitrated) were also held. 
Tramadol was restarted at a lower dose on the day of discharge 
and well tolerated.
 
# Urinary tract infection: patient with urinary frequency and 
pansensitive E coli in her urine culture. She was treated with 
ceftriaxone starting ___ and discharged with one day of 
cefpodoxime to complete a ___nemia: She was found to be anemic on admission around 7s with 
a small drop to 6.4 for which she received 1U pRBC with 
appropriate increase. Her H/H remained stable thereafter. Per 
her family she has chronic anemia. She may have element of MDS 
as she has borderline thrombocytopenia as well. She has a 
hip/buttock hematoma that remained stable. Iron studies showed 
an elevated ferritin and normal Fe, consistent with ACD. 

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
[] Patient discharged on cefpodoxime for 400 mg q12h for one day 
to complete a 5 day course of antibiotics for UTI
[] Patient with sutures in place; can be removed ___
[] Patient found to be anemic with unknown baseline; if not 
previously evaluated could consider further work up
[] Xray of the L humerus revealed: ""Multiple focal lucencies in 
the left humeral shaft could reflect osteopenia but raise 
concern for multiple myeloma or diffuse metastatic disease, 
which could be further evaluated with MRI, SPEP, and UPEP.""
[] Patients antihypertensives (atenolol and lisinopril) were 
stopped on admission due to fall and orthostatic hypotension. If 
she develops hypertension, can consider restarting.
[] Patient started on metoprolol succinate 25 mg daily for 
cardiac protection as atenolol was stopped
[] Patient's tramadol was decreased to 50 mg TID PRN
[] Patient's gabapentin was held on discharge

**The patient was seen and examined today and is stable for 
discharge. Greater than 30 minutes were spent on discharge 
coordination and counseling.**

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___,

You were admitted to the hospital after you fell and hit your 
head. You had a bleed in your brain but did not need surgery. 
You were found to have a small fracture in one of the small 
bones in your back but this was thought to have been present 
before you fell. You will follow up with spine doctors after ___ 
leave the hospital for this. You also hit your arm and hip but 
did not have any broken bones. 

You were found to have a urinary tract infection and treated 
with antibiotics. This may have contributed to your fall. You 
also were found to have low blood pressure when you stand up, so 
your blood pressure medications stopped. You can discuss 
restarting them with your primary care doctor.

You were found to be anemic (to have low blood counts) and got a 
blood transfusion. Your blood counts were stable after this. You 
may need further evaluation of your anemia by your primary care 
doctor unless this has already been done.

It was a pleasure participating in your care. We wish you all 
the best in the future!

Sincerely,

Your ___ team

Chief Complaint:
Seizures, Headaches, left frontal cavernous Malformation
 
Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
___ craniotomy for RSX of Cavernous malformation  
 
History of Present Illness:
Mr. ___ is a very pleasant ___ Caucasian male who was 
diagnosed with a left inferolateral frontal lobe cavernous 
malformation approximately ___ years ago in around ___.  He 
has had an episode where he had twitching of the right side of 
his tongue, some dysarthria and that resulted into more 
extensive simple partial seizures.  Now, this past ___, he 
again had a similar episode where he had twitching of the right 
side of his tongue and he had difficulty speaking.  He is 
currently taking Keppra 1000 mg once a day at night.  

A recent CT shows some hyperdensity within the lesion that is 
indicative of recent hemorrhage.  Given the fact that he has 
continuous seizures despite management of antiepileptic drugs 
and the vicinity of the small cavernoma to the brain surface, we 
think it is reasonable to remove it surgically.  We will set him 
up for surgical resection to a preresection Wand Brain Lab MRI 
prior.  He reviewed the risks and benefits of this operation and 
he is okay with preceding.

Surgery
 You underwent surgery to remove a Cavernous Malformation from 
your brain. 
 Please keep your incision dry until your staples are removed. 
 You may shower at this time but keep your incision dry.
 It is best to keep your incision open to air but it is ok to 
cover it when outside. 
 Call your surgeon if there are any signs of infection like 
redness, fever, or drainage. 

Activity
 We recommend that you avoid heavy lifting, running, climbing, 
or other strenuous exercise until your follow-up appointment.

 No driving while taking any narcotic or sedating medication. 
 If you experienced a seizure while admitted, you are NOT 
allowed to drive by law. 
 No contact sports until cleared by your neurosurgeon. You 
should avoid contact sports for 6 months. 

Medications
 Please do NOT take any blood thinning medication (Aspirin, 
Ibuprofen, Plavix, Coumadin) until cleared by the neurosurgeon. 
 You have been discharged on Keppra (Levetiracetam). This 
medication helps to prevent seizures. Please continue this 
medication as indicated on your discharge instruction. It is 
important that you take this medication consistently and on 
time. 
 You may use Acetaminophen (Tylenol) for minor discomfort if 
you are not otherwise restricted from taking this medication.

What You ___ Experience:
 You may experience headaches and incisional pain. 
 You may also experience some post-operative swelling around 
your face and eyes. This is normal after surgery and most 
noticeable on the second and third day of surgery.  You apply 
ice or a cool or warm washcloth to your eyes to help with the 
swelling. The swelling will be its worse in the morning after 
laying flat from sleeping but decrease when up. 
 You may experience soreness with chewing. This is normal from 
the surgery and will improve with time. Softer foods may be 
easier during this time. 
 Feeling more tired or restlessness is also common.
 Constipation is common. Be sure to drink plenty of fluids and 
eat a high-fiber diet. If you are taking narcotics (prescription 
pain medications), try an over-the-counter stool softener.

Followup Instructions:
___


Here is the coding results:D1802:Hemangioma of intracranial structures
I619:Nontraumatic intracerebral hemorrhage, unspecified
G40909:Epilepsy, unspecified, not intractable, without status epilepticus

Please output the coding reason:<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
","D18.02: Hemangioma of intracranial structures - Reason: The medical record mentions ""left inferolateral frontal lobe cavernous malformation"" which is a type of hemangioma. Although cavernous malformations can be benign vascular lesions, they are coded under hemangiomas in ICD-10.

I61.9: Nontraumatic intracerebral hemorrhage, unspecified - Reason: The record indicates that there was a recent CT showing ""some hyperdensity within the lesion that is indicative of recent hemorrhage."" This suggests a nontraumatic intracerebral hemorrhage, which is coded here as unspecified since the specific location is not clearly detailed in the provided information.

G40.909: Epilepsy, unspecified, not intractable, without status epilepticus - Reason: The patient has a history of seizures and is currently on antiepileptic medication (Keppra). The diagnosis of epilepsy is supported by the recurrent episodes of twitching and dysarthria, which are described as simple partial seizures. The term ""unspecified"" is used because the type of epilepsy is not specified, and ""not intractable"" is appropriate as the patient is managed with medication. There is no mention of status epilepticus."
